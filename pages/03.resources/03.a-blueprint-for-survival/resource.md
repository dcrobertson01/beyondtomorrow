A Blueprint for Survival was an influential environmentalist text that drew attention to the urgency and magnitude of environmental problems.

First published as a special edition of The Ecologist in January 1972, it was later published in book form and went on to sell over 750,000 copies.

The Blueprint was signed by over thirty of the leading scientists of the day—including Sir Julian Huxley, Sir Frank Fraser Darling, Sir Peter Medawar, E. J. Mishan and Sir Peter Scott. It was largely written by Edward Goldsmith and Robert Allen (with contributions from John Davoll and Sam Lawrence of the Conservation Society, and Michael Allaby) who argued for a radically restructured society in order to prevent what the authors referred to as “the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet”.
