This site uses markdown and the following conventions - particularly for rendering the original **Beyond Tomorrow** manifesto pages.

### Headings
The page headings should be added automatically from the header information. The first section header should be H3, or \#\#\# in markdown

### Quotes
Quotes should be formatted as \> markdown quotes. Citations as follows:

    > <span class="citation">[Martin Luther King] [mlk]</span>
            
A complete quote, with a link to the author.

    > “A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth . .. and say this is not just.”
    > <span class="citation">[Martin Luther King] [mlk]</span>
            
Rendered as 

> “A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth . .. and say this is not just.”
> <span class="citation">[Martin Luther King] [mlk]</span>

Don't forget to add the link information at the bottom or the page:

    [mlk]: /references/martin-luther-king "Martin Luther King"

[mlk]: /references/martin-luther-king "Martin Luther King"

### Values Policy
Policy is formatted using bullet points and using \!\!\!\! notice sectons.

The policy heading is a subheading of the policy section - this helps create a useful table of contents.

    !!!! #### The Values Party believes that:
    !!!! * We should stabilise at present levels, through the use of inter-national aircraft landing rights, the number of overseas tourists visiting New Zealand.
    !!!! * The tourist industry should cease to regard New Zealand as having a tourist “potential”. We should end expenditure on overseas advertising of New Zealand as a tourist resort.
