The speed with which western societies are changing is
a consequence not just of naturally evolving ideas and
attitudes but also of technological innovation that is too
often applied without due consideration for its impact
on the human spirit, on our cultures and on our way of
life.
 :
Advanced technology has been instrumental in the
development of the inhuman nature of modern society.
It has also been closely involved with the breakdown of
the living environment which supports human life, and
has been heavily responsible for the inroads being
made into the world’s non-renewable resources (part-
icularly fossil fuels).
A primary task of technology is to lighten the burden
of work we have to carry in order to stay alive and
develop our potentials. However, this has not worked
out in practice and one economist has remarked “the
amount of real leisure a society enjoys tends to be in
inverse proportion to the amount of labour saving
machinery it employs’.
Modern technology does reduce and sometimes
eliminate some work. But often it deprives us of the
type of work we enjoy most - creative useful work which
uses both our hands and our brains. Modern
technology has replaced this with processes of
production which are joyless and boring.
We need a different kind of technology, a technology
which, instead of making human hands and brains
redundant, helps them to become more productive.
This will not come easily, for anyone can make things
complicated but it takes a certain flair and real insight
to make things simple again.
The Values Party believes it is both reasonable and
possible to give a new direction to technological
development, a direction that will lead it back to the
real needs of all people, by continually exploring the
possibilities of smaller scale, more labour intensive
technologies.
Many developments
 in the scientific
 pipeline or in the
introductory stages overseas are likely to have a
considerable impact on society and we must either
prepare ourselves for them or reject them.
Somebody ought to be worrying now about their
ethical, cultural and environmental implications and
their long-term effects.
Associated with this technology assessment there
should be ongoing study of future directions and paths
open to New Zealand in its development and way of life.
There should be an independent board asking basic
questions and challenging conventional ideas about
“progress” and development.
Such a body could liaise and co-operate with the
Consumers’ Institute, social scientists, and trade union
and occupational groups in order to gather and
disseminate information. It should be constituted so
that it could receive public complaints and, if
necessary, hold hearings. [ts main role would be an
educative one, though it could recommend to the
government rejection of a technology if such a tech-
nology
 was
 under
 government
 control.
 If
 any
production or consumer technology was felt to be
socially harmful, the board would have the power and
facilities to mobilise public support to gain its
modification or its outright rejection. It should be
funded by government but be completely independent
It would be something
 like a technology
 ombudsman.
The Values Party would
e Encourage action by the United Nations to establish a body to keep
technological and scientific development under close observation.
e Support the establishment of a Futures Institute to charge future
paths and options open fo New Zealand in terms of its broad
development.
¢ Support the establishment
 of a Science and Technology
Assessment Board in New Zealand to assess the effects on society of
technologies
 likely to be introduced
 into this country
 in the future.
