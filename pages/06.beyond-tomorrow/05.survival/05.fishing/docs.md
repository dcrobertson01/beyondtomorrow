The Values Party supports the principle that both the sea and the sea-bed are the common heritage of mankind and that all nations, whether coastal or landlocked, have the right to benefit equally from them and to participate fully in decisions concerning mankind's use and care of them.

The Values Party supports the extension of New Zealand coastal waters to 200 miles. This area, with particular emphasis on the continental shelf, would be subject to strict management on behalf of the present and future world community. To this end the following further policies would be applied by a Values Govern- ment:
!!!! - Financial assistance would be provided for the development of a deep water fleet with particular emphasis on taking diversified types of fish for the world markets. e All seine trawling within 20 miles of the coast would be prohibited.
!!!! - Assistance would continue with the development of freshwater fish farming and salt water shell fish farming.
!!!! - No box net site would be approved without a prior hearing of interested parties.
!!!! - The Marlborough Sounds would be classed as a special area and no long line or set netting would be permitted. 
!!!! - Foreign control in the New Zealand fishing industry would be discouraged.
