Stabilising the population (sometimes referred to as zero population growth, or ZPG) is central to all Values Party policies. New Zealand's present rate of population growth of about two per cent adds approx- imately 60,000 people to the population every year - enough to populate a city the size of Lower Hutt. All of these people must be fed, clothed, housed, educated and employed. (A new primary school is needed for every 200 children, for example.) Moreover, every child has a right to be a wanted member of a family and of society, yet figures indicate that many births in New Zealand are unplanned and unwanted. Government statistics indicate that New Zealand's population will be approaching 5 million by the year 2000. Even if we begin an immediate programme 10 encourage populatjon stabilisation it is unlikely we could stabilise our population below that figure.

### Why do we need to stabilise our population? 

The world has finite resources. The needs of a rapidly increasing population are already putting unsustainable strains on our resources and our. physical environ- ment, yet on current trends the world's population will double within the next 35 years. The average New Zealander currently consumes approximately 30 times more resources than the average Asian - far more than our share of the world’s rapidly diminishing resources. We can hardly urge other countries to reduce their rate of population growth unless we are prepared to do the same ourselves. 

Although relatively underpopulated in terms of numbers in relation to its size and environment, New Zealand is not underpopulated in relation to its role in the world economy. This role is, and will be for the foreseeable future, almost entirely that of producing food. Our production of food is already efficient and highly developed and any increase will result from technology rather than an increase in the labour force. We largely depend on the sale of our agricultural products for our living in the world. Yet at a population of three million we already consume almost half the food we produce. New Zealand's contribution to the world food pool decreases as we eat more of our own produce and turn more farm land into residential land. 

We live in an industrial society where population growth entails more industrialisation with harmful effects on the environment. 

Population growth results in urban growth with its attendant social ills. 

The Values Party believes that the only hope for survival in the world fast running out of basic 16 resources is stable-state economics (see ‘The Stable Society’, ‘An Economic Recipe’). A pre-requisitite of this policy is a stable population. 

### What effects would stabilising our population have? 

Three key areas would be effected - our economy, our social environment and our physical environment. 
#### Economy 

A stable population would mean an enormous increase in per capita national wealth. It is estimated that up to one fifth of our national income is currently spent on providing the basic needs of more and more people in the future, rather than on making things better now. With a stable population this wealth could be released to help improve the quality of living for all, and to give more than token assistance to more needy populations overseas. 

Working hours could be substantially reduced. 

#### Social Environment 

Population growth is related to economic growth and technological change and these factors cause wide- ranging change in society. 

A growing population means that buildings are pulled down and bigger ones put up; houses are demolished and flats erected; cities spread into what was once familiar countryside; motorways scar cities and suburbs. In such an environment people start to lose their sense of “place” and ‘belonging’. Thousands of people in our cities display confusion, mounting anxiety, erratic swings of purpose, and a panicky urge to escape from it all. They complain they “can’t cope’. American sociologist Alvin Toffler coined a term for it - “future shock”. 

A stable population would greatly reduce the rate of change and the pace of life, to bring it back to a rate that people can cope with. There would be fewer unwanted pregnancies; greater social stability; more opportunities for individuals to develop in their own ways. Our housing, health, education and welfare services would be able to cope with our needs. Planning for our needs could be based on more predictable factors than at present. With a reduction in the rate of change and the rate of urban growth the climate would be right for a revival of the sense of community.

#### Physical Environment 

Population growth encourages economic growth which Is the chief cause of the environmental crisis. Ecologists throughout the world are warning that population and economic growth must be stabilised in order to stop pollution and ease the pressure on natural resources. The increasing demands of an increasing number of people will inevitably destroy the natural environment, regardless of any controls which might be put on industrial pollution. 

We can already see the environmental effects of current trends in such proposals as the utilisation of the South Island beech forests and the exporting of Mt Davy coal. 

A stable population would reduce the demands we make on our environment. It would ensure that New Zealanders continue to have access to wild, open spaces and outdoor living. 

### How the Values Party would stabilise the population 

Surveys indicate that about half the babies born in New Zealand are unplanned. New Zealand's excessive population growth is, therefore, not a conscious urge to reproduce which would require repressive govern- ment action to subdue. Rather, it is a failure of people to implement their own wishes. Values policies are aimed at giving people a real choice in having children, and the ability to implement that choice. 

We do not believe there should be any direct govern- ment action to limit family size. People should still have freedom of choice. Nor do we feel, at this stage, that there should be any financial disincentives to discourage larger families. Such measures would only be detrimental to children. 

While we do not believe that abortion should be regarded as a population control measure, it is probable that the Values Party policy on abortion would also have a substantial effect on population growth. 

Education in human relationships, in responsible parenthood, and in the social, ethical and physical aspects of sexuality is essential for all New Zealanders. Present provisions for such education are simply not adequate, as is indicated by the fact that in 1973, 9206 live births (15.16 per cent) were ex-nuptial and in 1974 over 10,000 New Zealand women had legal abortions here or in Australia . 

!!!! ### The Values Party supports  
!!!! * The extension of such education to all sections of society. In particular, the school curriculum should include a realistic programme of sex education and family life education. 
!!!! * The making of all contraceptives and contraceptive advice free and freely available to all regardless of age, sex or marital status [therefore repealing Section 2 of the 1954 amendment to the Police Offences Act 1954]. 
!!!! * The provision of free, voluntary sterilisation in an approved manner for both men and women, subject to adequate medical advice and professional counselling.
!!!! * A government-sponsored family planning programme which would include subsidies for organisations giving contraceptive advice and a general expansion of birth control facilities. 

### Immigration 

Immigration should be considered as part of an overall population policy. The Values Party believes that the number of immigrants to be admitted should reflect emigration figures so that the base of our population is not increased. The Values Party contends that as long as New Zealand continues to import skills, rather than train New Zealanders in these skills, the need for substantial immigration will continue, placing pressure on resources to support an increased population. We see a need for some continued immigration at present to maintain the level of skills in our economy; however, this should be accompanied, and eventually replaced, by a parallel programme to increase the level of skills within our indigenous population. 

#### The immigration of Polynesian Pacific islanders 

The Values Party believes that New Zealand can best meet its special obligations to these economically deprived areas of the Pacific in two ways. 

Firstly, through increased trade, and substantially increased aid and development programmes, New Zealand could help these countries to better support their own population without people having to suffer the personal and cultural dislocation of emigrating to a pakeha-dominated society with a totally different value system. 

Secondly, because the above would take time to achieve, New Zealand should continue to welcome a controlled number of Pacific Islanders as part of a total immigration policy to maintain a stable population. 

A problem facing many immigrants, especially those from the Pacific Islands, is adjusting to the different social patterns encountered in New Zealand society. An immigration programme should include assistance in obtaining housing and suitable work, and in generally adapting to New Zealand society. At the same time, efforts should be made to help immigrants retain useful and valuable aspects of their own culture. 

!!!! ### A Values Government would 
!!!! * Set annual quotas for immigration, based on emigration figures from New Zealand, so that the base of our population is not increased through immigration. 
!!!! * Continue to allow a restricted number of skilled immigrants into New Zealand to provide skills we need within our economy. 
!!!! * Aim to eventually replace skilled immigration through training for skills within our own population. 
!!!! * Continue to welcome new settlers from the Pacific Islands while at the same time increasing aid to the Islands themselves. 
!!!! * Set up a comprehensive orientation programme for all immigrants to help them adjust to New Zealand society. This programme would guarantee low-cost quality housing if required, help immigrants to find suitable work, and help them adjust to different social problems. 
!!!! * lncrease immigration on humanitarian grounds, for example, of refugees and stateless people. 
!!!! * Ensure a right of permanent residence for spouses of New Zealand citizens and for parents and grandparents of a permanent immigrant.
