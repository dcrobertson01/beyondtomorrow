“Ma te turangawaewae ka kitea te mana o te ran-
gatira.”
“The stability of the land upon which you stand will
determine your security.”
Sir Eruera Tirikatene
Values agricultural policy is based on the principle of
optimum sustainable production from our land
resource.
We believe that this country’s greatest economic
assets are its land, climate and accumulated farming
skills.
We believe New Zealand's future depends on the
rational use of these assets.
We believe that fundamental to the fulfilment of our
objectives in agriculture are long term policies aimed at
ensuring a flourishing and vital rural community.
The rural land of New Zealand is the nation’s most
important economic, recreational, and ecological
resource. Managed wisely it will support and provide
for future generations of New Zealanders. But rational
management must be more than a pious hope if itis to
remedy the mistakes of our forefathers. Four
generations of European settlement have seen vast
ecological changes - changes which have amply
demonstrated the vulnerability of both our native
forests which protect the watersheds and the
farmlands which feed the nation. Primary industry,
farming and forestry, is the mainstay of the New
Zealand economy. Agriculture alone, being only
partially dependent on scarce non-renewable
resources, endows New Zealand with a significant
comparative advantage in trade, so that the primary
sector must be seen as the basis of the economy for
many years to come.
New Zealand's economy is unique. No other country
in the world has managed to maintain a similar
standard of living on a basis of primary industry. Today
we are at a crisis-point.
In recent years there have been calls from farmers
and others, including economics, for taxpayer support
of farmers’ incomes. When these demands first became
vocal in the late 1960s the common reaction was one of
surprise. How can the taxpayer support the industry
that supports the national economy? Nevertheless,
input subsidies were introduced, then cash grants such
as the sheep retention scheme - all ad hoc measures
iust to keep farms producing. Today there are few
informed observers who doubt that New Zealand's
much vaunted farming industry is going to be a
continuing drain on the taxpayer. Why?
Farmer dependence on government assistance has
coincided with high rates of world inflation, which
boosted our internal cost structure to the point where
land-based industries which compete on world markets
24
can no longer afford to maintain production.
New Zealand now has to decide whether primary
industry must live a welfare existence or whether it
wants to restructure the economy so that agriculture
can maintain efficient production and cater for the
wider needs of the New Zealand people. The problem is
not that New Zealand agriculture is inefficient, rather
the reverse. The point is that agriculture can no longer
carry the cost of New Zealand's industrialisation
policies alone. Declining farming communities provide
a barometer for rural prospects. Farm incomes have
been squeezed between rapidly rising domestic
production costs and relatively static overseas prices.
Farms have necessarily been amalgamated to ensure:
an increased income for farmers. Farming districts
have become socially desolate as labour has departed
to urban environments, home of protected industry.
While the New Zealand farm population has been
declining both in absolute terms and as a proportion of
the total population the rural industries have been
required to expand production at a rate sufficient to
meet the increasing consumption needs of a growing
population and the - increasing . export income
requirements of an expanding economy.
The Values Party believes that the well-being of
those who manage rural land is vital to the economic
future of the country and to the well-being of the land
itself. We also believe that many of New Zealand's
urban social problems arise from the stresses of forced
urbanisation - a drift to the larger cities which could be
reversed by the introduction of an enlightened farm
incomes policy.
The Values Party would
e Introduce guaranteed incomes for the average efficient farmer.
Equity alone would be a sufficient reason for this
action. However, economic necessity makes it
imperative. Until New Zealand achieves a stable
population the growth of her agricultural production
must match further increases in the nation’s
population if living standards are to be maintained. The
reasons for this are two-fold; first, the Values Party
believes that New Zealand has a moral responsibility to
increase food production in a malnourished world; and
secondly, we depend on agriculture for our very
survival as a nation. We now consume more than
one-third of our static food production. The neglect of
agriculture at the expense of industrial growth has
been a recurring folly which has hampered the
economic and social development of Third World
countries. The continued neglect of agriculture in New
Zealand is a formula for economic suicide.
The regional development or assistance plans of the
National and Labour parties are an acknowledgment of
the slow death by depopulation of rural New Zealand.
Encouraging industry into provincial areas with
“Incentives” does little to solve the basic problem. The
answer lies in our economic base - on our farms. The
Values Party believes that given stable but adequate
farm incomes, the multitude of rural servicing and
processing industries will thrive in the smaller urban
centres. The stop-go policies of the past, with their
inflationary side effects (in times of high prices) and
recession and redundancy (in times of low prices) will
be effectively countered.
Recent economic events have made it apparent to
many farmers and to the Values Party that New
Zealand agriculture is desperately in need of an
equitable rural, social and economic policy which will
guarantee technically efficient farms, a reasonable
standard of living for our farmers, and will help make
rural districts better places to live.
The Land
Utilisation and Ecology
The Values Party's ultimate aim is to discontinue all
land-use practices which are inconsistent with the
objective of a stable land surface and sound ecological
principles. Where producers are significantly affected
full and adequate compensation would be instituted.
Values believes that in general, land should be
reserved for those purposes for which it is best suited -
and therefore definite standards and guidelines of land
use capability would be established. A detailed water
and soil survey would be initiated by the DSIR to
determine the precise nature and extent of our water
and soil resources. This more precise clarification is
regarded as an urgent priority to provide much-needed
accurate information on which sound town and country
planning land use decisions can be made. Arable land
requires survey at a more intense scale than
non-arable hill country. In the long term this
information would be used as the accurate base of land
classification for the assessment of an annual land
rating.
Because so little of New Zealand's farm land is
naturally fertile those soils which have a high arable or
intensive farming potential would be carefully
protected from housing, industrial or other
encroachment.
Land is not only an economic resource. It is also the
nation’s most important recreational asset and as such
belongs to the people of New Zealand. With this
principle in mind a system of walk-ways and natural
reserves giving access to areas of natural beauty would
be encouraged by a Values Government. Regional
communities would be empowered to declare residual
aras of native bush, forest or vegetation in farming
districts as natural reserves.
The Values Party would
@ Expand agricultural research in two major directions. Firstly,
develop new technologies to increase agricultural production where
appropriate. Secondly, develop new technologies which are more in
keeping with sound ecological principles than those currently in use.
Values believes that while most New Zealand soils
are naturally deficient in phosphate the current means
of remedying this deficiency through application of
superphosphate may not necessarily be the best, from
the point of view of either achieving maximum
sustainable production or following sound ecological
principles.
Research would be aimed at:
- developing plants and production systems which
minimise the need for artificial fertiliser;
- establishing the precise nutrient and trace element
status of farm land so that farmers can apply fertiliser
in scientifically measured amounts rather than by rule
of thumb (Values policies would immediately change
the present system where large quantities of fertiliser
are sometimes applied purely to avoid tax).
One of the strengths of New Zealand agriculture is
the development of legume-based systems which
biologically fix nitrogen, thus eliminating the need for
artificial nitrogen fertilisers whose production uses up
non-renewable energy resources. Further research will
be aimed at the continued development and
improvement of biological nitrogen-fixing systems.
Development of two-tier farming, mixing grazing and
forestry, will be given priority under Values.
Differential tax rebates would be implemented to
ensure a wide variety of trees, including natives, are
planted and research would be aimed at selecting the
most suitable species for different areas and end-uses.
A major aspect of this policy would be the
encouragement of tree-crops such as nuts which so far
have been largely neglected as a valuable source of
protein production which complements rather than
competes with the traditional production of animal
protein.
Various trials in New Zealand (almost exclusively
using pinus radiata) have demonstrated that two-tier
farming can increase pasture production, stabilise
land, decrease nutrient run-off and make better use of
available nutrients in the soil.
The Values Party believes that the Agricultural
Chemicals Board must be composed of suitably
qualified objective members without vested interests
in the industry, and given sufficient powers to ensure
that natural ecosystems and the farming industry are
protected from the indiscriminant use of expensive,
potentially dangerous and frequently unsuitable
pesticides and herbicides.
Research would be aimed at the development of
plants and animals which are naturally resistant to
parasites and diseases; and the development of
specific chemical control, and biological controls for
insect pests and diseases.
The Values Party would
@ Seek to restore stability to the basic renewable sources of soil,
water and air. This would be part of an overall strategy toward
eliminating pollution and instituting conservation of New Zealand's
basic non-renewable resources. Such a policy would follow common
principles throughout New Zealand and would be applied equitably
but with due regard to social priorities.
The Values Party recognises that the precarious
instability of many of our human-controlled enter-
prises, involving loss of soil structure and fertility
in many areas, susceptibility to plagues of insects and
bacterial and virus diseases, is due largely to the
artificial simplicity which we have imposed on nature.
Values would seek to maintain the stability of natural
communities in order to achieve permanent high
production at optimum sustainable yields and
minimum energy expenditures.
A Rural Economic Policy
The New Zealand farming industry works on the
economic principle that world price, less costs of
production, equals farm profit. The rest of the economy
works according to the formula - cost of production,
plus profit margin, equals local selling price.
Because New Zealand's comparative advantage lies
in our primary industries New Zealand agriculture in
the short-term must be placed on an equivalent basis.
This would necessitate an intermediary council to
co-ordinate the marketing of agricultural produce.
Working through existing market channels the council
would buy-in at prices which would give the average
efficient farmer a reasonable return on his investment
and wage for his labour. It would sell the produce to the
best of its ability on the local and overseas market. If
the Government wished to hold consumer prices it
could implement consumer subsidies. It is essential
that the co-ordinating council represent all national
interests because the produce would in effect be
owned by the whole country.
If the selling price were less than that paid out to the
farmers the council would seek government export
credit assistance. (The nation determines the cost of
production which determines the price paid to farmers.
It therefore must accept responsibility if that price is
higher than the overseas market can realise.)
A number of points arise:
- market demand and consumer preference would
have to be taken into account in setting the prices paid
to farmers;
- farmers would no longer receive subsidies, they
would receive a just price;
- production would be maintained at a high and
increasing level while this was necessary;
- since the public would in effect own the produce, it
would take a greater interest in its fate and pay far
more attention to anything that had a detrimental
effect on its acceptability overseas.
The system outlined would imply a change to trading
with countries which have a greater need for our
produce. The principle of mutually beneficial trade
should be allowed to operate freely. Bilateral trade
agreements with Third World countries would be
undertaken.
The Values Party calls for a more responsible New
Zealand attitude towards the world wheat production
shortfall, in the form of a government guaranteed
minimum price to farmers equal to, or more than, the
imported price of grain.
Rural Land Policy
The general consequences of the structural adjust-
ments that have been taking place in New Zealand
agriculture are fewer farmers, larger farms, and an
increase in the size and complexity of the farm
business.
The Values Party's longer-term policy aim is to
secure nearly all revenues at the point of basic
resource use rather than on earnings and it is Party
policy to introduce resource taxes proportionate to the
availability of resources. With these policies in mind, a
Values Government would
The Values Party would
o Gradually reduce the emphasis on income taxes for farmers and
would increase per-acre land rates on farm land. The value of farm
27
production in excess of an assessed rating level would be free of
income tax. The land rate would be adjusted over time to provide rural
people with incomes comparable to those in urban areas.
The Values Party believes that rural depopulation is
not in the national interest because amalgamation of
farms in the long-run, despite technological advances,
leads to declining per-acre production.
Values believes that production per unit of area and
not per man should be the yardstick of economic
performance within the agricultural sector.
High capital values of farm land are a barrier to
young people of modest means who wish to go farming,
encourage land speculation, and tend to hinder the
most productive use of our farming resources by those
best able to utilise farm land productively.
Traditionally, the capital gain made from the sale of a
farm has been viewed as a farmer's superannuation. In
the face of fluctuating and generally inadequate farm
incomes and a high rate of income “plough back’ the
sale of a farm on retirement provided security for a
farmer that he otherwise would not have been able to
enjoy.
However with the adoption of a guaranteed farm
incomes policy it would be inequitable for farmers to
continue to draw untaxed income from the sale of farm
land - especially when developed from pre-tax farm
income. Also, in a period of high inflation, the influence
of land speculation on farm land values will continue to
exact a high economic and social toll.
Fifty per cent of New Zealand farmers are over the
age of 45. Many - if not most of them - would like to be
able to sell their farms to their heirs if it was possible
for the heirs to be able to accrue enough capital to pay
the deposit. With the capital value of most farms now
well in excess of $100,000, where does an aspiring farm
owner start?
The only effective solution is to increase the turnover
of farm land ownership:-
The Values Party would:
e In the short term, to facilitate this, a Values Government would
remove farm land from the free market. All sales of land excepting
sales at valuation from one generation to the next within families,
would be through a district land commission. The capital value of rural
farm land would be frozen at market worth at the time the scheme
was introduced, with increases in value allowed for only on increases
in productive worth.
- sales would be conducted by ballot. All ballotees would have to
demonstrate their ability to manage land wisely and productively
before being eligible for pastoral or arable farms.
- the scheme would be supported by mortgages up to 95 per cent
through the Rural Bank. As land sales values would move on to the
basis of productive value any average efficient owner would be
assured of meeting his mortgage commitments. these mortgages
would also be available for father-heir sales. Where in the initial
stages, the pegged value of the land exceeded its productive worth,
the state would pay the difference to the vendor as an annuity.
28
This, combined with Values Policy of reducing values
of farm land to real productive worth, would open the
land market up to people best able to utilise farm land
productively. The private ownership of farm land would
not be affected. Values recognises that the ownership
of farm land by a family gives that family a place of
belonging - a “turangawaewae” - and puts an
obligation on the owners to care for the land. The
ambition of most farmers is that their children should
farm the land after them - an attitude which ensures
the land is not wantonly exploited.
In order to meet changes in land use, the commission
would be empowered to subdivide or aggregate land
into larger or smaller ownership units. The criteria for
determining the size of a holding would generally be
that required to provide one family with a reasonable
living. Larger holdings would be allocated according to
demand from co-operative farming groups.
Because land is a scarce resource which is easily
destroyed or damaged,
The Values Party believes
e Land ownership should generally only be open to New Zealand
citizens.
e Land should only be occupied by the people who own it. The
generous mortgage provisions outlined above would generally
eliminate the need for trust or company ownership of land by families.
e Co-operative or group owners would have to be permanently
domiciled on the land. A family or individual would be able to have
shares in only one such rural land owning group. Each group would
have to be registered as a legal entity - company, trust or society - be-
fore being eligible for ballot. In general, the same rules applying to
individuals would apply to groups owning farm land.
¢ That encouragement should be given to the development of
hamlets and villages with full servicing facilities whereby a farmer or a
farm worker can retire to a rural environment. This will encourage the
rural retention of population.
The Co-operative Enterprise in Agriculture
The Values Party believes that the family, extended
family, or co-operative farm is likely to be at least as
efficient as corporate farm enterprises in the long term.
The Values Party supports
® Communal farming [ohu] and research into alternative forms of co-
operative ownership and assistance to groups wishing to establish a
co-operative group.
@ The establishment and development of co-operatives in the supply
of agricultureal inputs and the processing and marketing of agri-
cultural products. This would be a means of improving producer
bargaining power.
© The provision of a framework for facilitating continued
improvements in marketing efficiency, based on both on both a
central producer board, and regional co-operative marketing.
® The establishment of farm machinery pools and the associated ob-
taining of farm capital equipment.
