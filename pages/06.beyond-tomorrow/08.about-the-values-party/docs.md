About the Values Party
Many
 New
 Zealanders
 contemplating
 the
 general
elections three years ago felt their choices were no
choice at all.
National and Labour alike seemed unable to compre-
hend, let alone tackle, the forces which threatened
 the
fabric of communities and the very structure of society
itself.
Indeed people's disillusionment
 and despair arose
because
 rather
 than
 just
 ignoring
 New
 Zealand's
problems the political monopoly seemed
 intent
 on
perpetuating them.
A 25 year-old journalist and political science
graduate studying in Wellington tackled the problem
head on. In May, 1972, six months before the elections,
Tony Brunt formed the N.Z. Values Party.
With the assistance
 of a few friends
 and supporters
the Values Party slowly grew in strength until a tele-
vision current affairs programme catapulted it into the
national consciousness five weeks before the election.
With the national publicity gained, Values was
launched as a national political party, and hundreds of
people beseiged radio and television stations to find
out how to get hold of its organisers.
 Eventually the
party stood 42 candidates
 instead of the six or seven
initially envisaged and gained two per cent of the total
vote.
Since then the Values Party has undergone
considerable change. Consistent with its policy of
community and social action, there has been consider-
able activity at branch level - recycling projects, conser-
vation and environment protection, town planning
activism, legislation resisting high-rise development
and over-catering
 for private
 cars, and the
presentation of submissions to Government select
committees considering
 such matters
 as population
and education.
In 1974 the Values Party moved into local body
politics, an area which many party members believe to
be equally as important as national politics. As a result,
a number of councillors were elected at the October
elections. At its second annual conference late last year
the party decided it should, for the purpose of contest-
ing the
 1975
 general
 elections,
 develop
 a stronger
central organisation.
 In deciding to contest the
elections the party decided its campaign should be
primarily one of education
 - to use the political arena
 as
a means to make people aware of the ideas and policies
it believes
 are crucial for the survival
 and well being of
people in New Zealand. In April of this year those
policies were formulated at a national policy-making
conference of party members in Christchurch. Reg
Clough, of Auckland, was elected leader of the party in
1974 and Cathy Wilson, deputy leader. Tony Brunt
stood
 down
 in order
 to concentrate
 on
 local
 body
politics and has since been elected to the Wellington
City Council.

It is a stated intention of the Values Party to become
the Government, thus placing it in the best possible
position
 to
 implement
 policy.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
recognising the urgency of action in many areas, it
offers its ideas to all others.
 If another political party
and/or
 government
 adopts
 Values policy, we count
that as a success. On that basis the Values Party has
achieved a number of successes in its short life -
including its part in the greatly heightened awareness
of environmental issues and the very serious consider-
ation the Government
 is currently giving to a
population
 policy.
As in 1972 our election manifesto is an important
part of our campaign. We believe a clear yet compre-
hensive reference to our policies is the best way to
enable voters to consider what we are advocating. We
believe the Values Party has already made a positive
contribution to our society and that it has an important
role to play in the future.
