"The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectivly, in interfering wioth the liberty of action  of any of their number is self-protection. The only purpose for which power can be rightfully excercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others"

John Stuart
 Mill, “On Liberty’
 1859.
Much of our social legislation is based on a Victorian
morality which is not only irrelevant, but often patently
unjust. In some cases it even works against the attain-
ment of reasonable social goals.
The Values Party believes as a matter of principle
that we must allow individual freedom unless it is
clearly outweighed by the interests of the community
as a whole. We therefore propose reforms in the
following areas.
Family Planning
Our policies on family planning
 are
 based
 on 3
premises:
e Every child born should be wanted.
e Family planning is a basic human right which was recognised by the
United Nations in 1968.
e All persons
 should
 have
 the right
 to choose
 which
 method
 they
prefer to control their fertility.
Education in human relationships, in responsible
parenthood, and in the social, ethical, and physical
aspects
 of sexuality
 is essential
 for all New Zealanders.
Present provisions for such education are simply not
adequate, as is indicated by the fact that in 1973, 9206
live births (15.16%) were ex-nuptial ana in 1974 over
10,000 New Zealand women had legal abortions
 here
or in Australia.
The Values Party advocates:
eo The
 extension
 of such
 educations
 to all sections
 of society.
 In
particular, the school curriculum should include
 a
 realistic
programme of sex education and family life education.
e The making
 of all contraceptives
 and contraceptive
 advice free and
freely
 available
 to all,
 regardless
 of age,
 sex,
 or
 marital status,
[therefore repealing Section 2 of the 1954 Amendment fo the Police
Offences
 Act].
e The provision of free, voluntary sterilisation in an approved manner
for both men and women, subject to adequate medical advice and
professional counselling.
e A government-sponsored family planning programme which would
include subsidies for organisations giving contraceptive advice and a
general expansion of birth control facilities.
These measures would, in the long-run, reduce
drastically the incidence of unwanted pregnancies in
New Zealand,
 which
 is at present
 far too high. Other
helpful measures include advising couples of genetic
risk before conception, preventing the marketing of
deformity-inducing drugs, and extra aid to families who
would adopt mentally or physically handicapped
children.
In the meantime more of the women at present
opting for abortion might opt instead to continue their
pregnancies if they could be sure of more caring
support from the community during the pregnancy and
birth, and especially during the first decade of child-
rearing. In addition to free and adequate pre and
post-natal care, there needs to be more community
support for all families with young children. Low-cost
housing within healthy active communities should be
available for single-parent families.
Since the measures we advocate above are not
currently being applied adequately, thousands
 of
women annually face unwanted pregnancies and opt
for abortion rather than adoption or compulsory
motherhood through hastened or forced marriages,
single parenthood or adding to an existing family.
The Values Party does not advocate abortion, just as
it does not advocate the use of alcohol or other drugs.
However, it believes that prohibition infringes a basic
human right to freedom of conscience. (Article 18 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights: “Everyone has
the right to freedom of thought, conscience and
religion.)
An abortion is preceded by an ethical decision and a
medical decision. We do not believe that either decision
should be made by legislators or pressure groups. The
individual
 woman should
 have freedom
 of conscience
to make the ethical decision. A registered doctor should
make the medical decision.
There is no agreement among doctors, women,
churches, legislators, or the population at large on
exactly when worth, personality, and rights begin in the
continuum of human life. We believe that the whole
community is divided on the issue. In both main
pressure groups (for and against) there are people of
intelligence and integrity who are motivated by a
respect for life and human rights.
51
No-one will ever be able to prove which group
 is right.
The ethical considerations involved in abortion are too
complex and personal
 to warrant
 inflexible or
intolerant judgements. Laws should therefore not be
based on these considerations and should not force the
opinions of either pressure group on the whole
population. A Heylen Poll in May 1975 found that 56%
of New Zealanders
 supported
 unrestricted
 legalisation
of abortion. Yet one month later, 43 male members of
parliament passed Dr Wall's amendment
 to the
Hospital Act.
The Values Party believes that:
- those whose conscience forbids them to have
anything to do with abortion should not be required to
do so;
- the decision on whether or not a woman should
obtain an obortion should be made by her and her
doctor, since each woman's beliefs, medical history and
situation are unique.
- where paternity is established and there is a bond
between the couple concerned, the man could well be
included in the process of deciding about abortion.
However if the couples’ preferences conflict, the
woman's
 choice
 should
 prevail.
 After
 all,
 current
adoption practice entails the consent of the mother
only because it is the mother who literally “gives’ birth.
The Values Party endorses the statement in its 1972
manifesto (pp10 and 56) that: “Our party's stand on
abortion is not based on the desire to reduce
population growth. We believe that abortion is the least
desirable form of birth control and should not be
regarded as a substitute for contraception.” It would
repeal
 all existing legislation
 on abortion (including Dr
Wall's
 Hospital Amendment
 Act) because there is no
need for legislators to single out one form of medical
treatment for special legislation. Other laws regarding
medical practices provide adequate safeguards and
ensure that every abortion would be carried out by a
registered
 medical practitioner
 in an approved
manner.
Other reasons
 for repealing existing legislation on
abortion are:
- The law discriminates
 against many thousands
 of
women
 and
 doctors
 who
 in all conscience
 do
 not
believe that the termination of a pregnancy is sinful,
irresponsible, or the concern of anyone but themselves.
- The law is not clear to doctors,
 legislators,
 or to the
general public. The brunt of this difficulty and the risk
involved in interpreting it is borne by doctors and
women.
 As the law is currently
 applied,
 women
 with
means can readily
 obtain
 an abortion
 but
 poorer
women cannot.
- The
 law is not effective
 since
 thousands
 of illegal
abortions continue to be performed
 in New Zealand
each year and some
 4,000
 New Zealand
 women
 fly to
Australia annually seeking abortions.
- The
 law prevents
 doctors
 from
 doing
 what
 they
consider best for their patients.
52
In addition, the Values Party would establish free
outpatient clinics along the lines of the Remuera
Medical Centre throughout the country. Such clinics
would:
- ensure that counselling was available before a
woman made her decision and that contraceptive
advice was given to avoid further
 unwanted
pregnancies;
- use early-term vaccuum aspiration (with or without
local anaesthesia),
 which
 is a less
 dangerous
 and
traumatic method than the traditional one (evacuation
curettage under general anaesthesia).
- prevent
 unnecessary
 delay
 in
 terminating
pregnancies.
Finally,
 the
 Values
 Party
 would
 promote
 many
measures to raise the status of women so that fulfilling
alternatives to having children were readily available,
so that women did not just drift irresponsibly into
motherhood, and so that respect for women and
children would deter men from irresponsibly fathering
children.
Censorship
The Values Party believes that censorship inhibits the
development of responsible adult citizenship. We
would encourage the principle of individual responsi-
bility for moral behaviour. Although we accept that in
our present society some censorship may be necessary
in the interests of children, we would prefer to see this
responsibility left with parents rather than assumed by
the State.
The Values Party would
e Require more information and guidelines on the nature of
literature, films and broadcasts to be readily available to enable
people to make decisions for themselves rather than having such
decisions made for them by the State.
e Review the Indecent Publications Act with a view to reducing
censorship of books, documents and newspapers.
e Repeal the Cinemotograph
 Films Act and replace it by legislation
which would enable films to be shown to restricted
 audiences
 [if
necessary] rather than be cut.
o Establish
 a Royal
 Commission
 to
 examine
 the
 definitions
 of
obscenity, indecency, pornography and violence, and to study the
effect of such material on individuals and society with special
reference to its influence on character development
 and its
relationship to criminal or other anti-social behaviour.
Privacy
With the increasing scale and complexity of our society,
there has been a trend towards collection by
government and private agencies of data relating to
the affairs of individual citizens. Where data collection
relating to identifiable individuals is necessary, we
believe that extensive safeguards should be provided
to ensure that it is available only for the purpose for
which it has been collected.
The Values Party would
e Abolish the Security Intelligence Service.
e Ensure that all records kept on an individual by any organisation be
available on demand to that person or his legal representative for
perusal and correction.
Sexual Laws
The Values Party does not believe that the State has
any role in regulating sexual practices between
consenting adults in private.
In relation to current
 arguments
 for and against
homosexual law reform, it should be noted that:
- The
 present
 law
 discriminates
 between
 male
homosexual acts which are criminal and female
homosexual acts which are not.
- Homosexuals and paedophiliacs (men who inter-
fere with children) are two almost entirely separate
groups and no one who advocates homosexual law
reform advocates any reduction in penalties for
assaults on children. (Research
 indicates that
heterosexuals
 are
 more
 likely to become
 paedoph-
iliacs than homosexuals.)
- The individual homosexual suffers under a social
strain and a fear of public humiliation which is hard
enough to bear without the addition of a sense of guilt
and a fear of public persecution.
 The present
 law is
hypocritically and very arbitrarily
 enforced yet the
risk of prosecution
 or blackmail
 is ever present
 for all
practising homosexuals.
- Reform
 of the
 law will in no way
 reduce
 the
penalties for assaults on children.
The Values Party would
e Repeal all laws proscribing sexual practices in private between
consenting persons of consenting age.
e Repeal all laws discriminating against homosexuals, and redraft
laws relating to matters such as sexual assault so that they apply
equally to heterosexuals and homosexuals.
Drug Laws
We do not advocate the use of drugs in any form, but
we believe ‘that existing drug laws are hypocritical,
inconsistent and often make the problem worse.
Alcohol and Tobacco
While the average New Zealander tends to think of
drug abuse largely in terms of those drugs which
produce a strong physical dependence,
 such as
narcotics, there is overwhelming evidence that the
drugs which are causing harm to the greatest number
of people are alcohol and nicotine.
The Values Party would
eo Take immediate
 steps to place breweries under community control
[see “EconomicsTM] [Note that this does not mean national
isation].
¢ Prohibit all advertising of alcohol and tobacco products except at
the point of sale.
e Require commercial organisations profiting from the sale of alcohol
to recognise their larger social responsibilities by helping to finance
community
 controlled
 alcoholic rehabilitation
 and
 research
programmes.
Marijuana
On evidence presently available it appears that
marijuana is less dangerous to health than either
alcohol or tobacco. It is thus hard to justify the
prohibition of marijuana when we don’t prohibit alcohol
or cigarettes. It is no argument to suggest that we
should not allow yet another social evil. As a matter of
principle we must allow individual freedom unless it is
outweighed by the interests of the community as a
whole.
Nor is it an argument to suggest that marijuana
should be prohibited because it leads to the use of
more dangerous drugs. This would be the same as pro-
hibiting social drinking because it can lead to alco-
holism. In any event there is no evidence of a causal re-
lationship between marijuana and “hard” drugs.
The relatively minor penalties now imposed by the
courts for a first offence of private possession and use
of marijuana are no deterrent
 and, given the
widespread
 disregard
 for the law and the cost to the
community
 of attempting
 to enforce it, the provision of
any penalty is pointless.
However, as with alcohol and tobacco, we do not
believe the use of marijuana should be encouraged,
and we are opposed to its commercial exploitation and
promotion.
The Values Party would
¢ Remove penalties for the growing and private use of marijuana, but
prohibit the sale for profit of marijuana.
Addictive Drugs
We believe that the objective in dealing with those
addicted to drugs should be rehabilitation rather than
punishment. Apart from having little apparent effect in
combating drug addiction, the existence of criminal
penalties hinders rehabilitation by deterring addicts
from seeking help; leads to drug pushers with a vested
interest in increasing the number of addicts; drives
addicts to criminal activities to obtain drugs and/or
money to buy them. The policies outlined below would
to a large extent eliminate the drug pusher’s market.
Evidence suggests that there are many more people
addicted to legally prescribed drugs- than to drugs
illegally obtained.
The Values Party would
eo Implement stricter supervision
 of commercial manufacturers and
distributors involved in the legal distribution and sale of drug
supplies.
e Retain penalties for unlawful production, distribution, and sale of
addictive drugs.
e Remove criminal penalties for possession for private use of
addictive drugs.
e Set up government funded clinics providing programmes of
maintenance and treatment for drug addicts.
Firearms
e Increase penalties for anyone found in possession of an
unregistered firearm at any time.
e Ensure that warrant of fitness examinations are carried out on all
firearms at regular intervals.
53
e Grant an amnesty to anyone surrendering an unregistered firearm
at any time.
e Ensure that proficiency tests be carried out at specified intervals
for all firearm licence holders.
e Make licences to operate firearms
 more difficult to obtain.
Divorce
 Law Reform
e Make irreconcilable
 breakdown
 of marriage
 the only grounds
 for
divorce.
e Reform the divorce laws to make them less discriminating towards
males.
Miscellaneous
The Values Party would
e Reform the Police Offences
 Act to make it less arbitrary
 and open to
abuse,
o Replace fulltime magistrates by part-time magistrates drawn from
practising solicitors on a roster basis administered by the Justice
Department [this is an attempt to overcome the often conservative
and out-of-touch
 administration
 of the law in our Magistrates
 Courts].
e Amend present libel laws to make them less restrictive and enable
adequate public discussion of important issues.
e Abolish private security firms.
e Make New Zealand's highest court a New Zealand court, not the
Privy Council as at present.
o Make legal aid available as of right to defendants in criminal cases.
e Endorse the ideal of open government at all levels, particularly with
reference to open meetings and freedom of information.
