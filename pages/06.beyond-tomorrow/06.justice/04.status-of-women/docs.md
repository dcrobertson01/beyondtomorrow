> Discrimination against women is incompatible with human dignity and with the welfare of the family and of society, prevents their participation on equal terms with men in the political, social, economic and cultural life of their countries and is an obstacle to the full development of the potentialities of women in the service of their countries and of humanity
> <span class="citation">United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women</span>

The Values Party supports the work of the UN Commission on the status of women and endorses the UN aims in designating this year as International Women's Year. We believe it is time that the status of women be considered an important priority in New Zealand politics and have taken the initiative by offering a comprehensive policy in this chapter of our party's manifesto.

However we would not be content with raising the status of women simply on male terms. We aim also to raise the status of traditional womens values which have stressed co-operation rather than competition, nurturing, healing, and cherishing instead of exploiting, destroying and conquering, and peace instead of conflict. We agree with Matthew Arnold that “if ever the world sees a time when women shall come together purely and simply for the benefit and good of mankind, it will be a power such as the world has never known."

We hope that International Women's Year will be that time but stress that it “must not benefit only a small minority of women, conferring on them a spurious and privileged equality in an unequal world. If International Women's Year becomes obsessed by this kind of equality - equality for the few inside the old structures at the expense of many and of the possibility of new structures - it will be irrelevant to the vast majority of women” (“New Internationalist” Jan. 1975.)

We therefore ask New Zealand women to broaden their women’s movement so that “it does not simply seek admission to a system which is itself leading the world into despair” (Ibid). We commend to them all our party's policies for building an alternative system which would stress values that women have traditionally perceived were more important than those which currently prevail.

The Values Party's policy on the status of women is based on five premises: 

* there are biological differences between men and women but far too much has been made of them and they do not justify a vast and inequitable system of discrimination against women throughout society;
* no human qualities should be culturally labelled “male” or “female”. We want to create a cultural environment where all qualities can come out in all people;
* each individual person has a right to find out the kind of person she or he is, to strive to become that person and to choose in what capacity she or he will serve society. Society should offer the same opportunities and encouragement to all to realise their individual potential;
* in a truly equal society women would be in a position comparable to men in that they would be able to combine occupational and other roles with those of spouse and parent. Men and women should share
equally the responsibility for home and children;
* every time we liberate a woman we liberate a man ...

We need the imagination, dedication, and creativity of everyone ... for a mutually respecting and supportive planetary society.” (Dr Margaret Mead.)

### Education at Home

New Zealand society is characterised by a sexual version of apartheid. From the beginning children are taught concepts of masculinity and femininity, both deliberately and unconsciously. A girl's attention is directed in and on herself and the home. A boy is conditioned to look out to society and the world. Initiative, aggression and competitive instincts are strongly fostered in male children; tenderness, self control and flexibility in female children. 

Girls are encouraged to be decorative, helpful and clean. Boys are encouraged to be adventurous, curious and rough. Girls have different toys and different books from boys. Relatively few toys are usually given to children of both sexes. Books for children reflect the same bias. Many studies show that two thirds of story books feature boys compared with one third featuring girls in both illustrations and text.
Education in sex roles outside of formal education is the main influence in keeping the status of women low. It is not so much that it controls a woman's alternatives but rather her motivation to choose any but one of those alternatives. As a result, half the population is under-rated, under-encouraged and under-achieving. How many potentially effective human beings can we afford to suppress in the name of traditional role playing?
!!!! #### The Values Party would
!!!! * Reorient education to emphasise cooperation, caring, sharing and the worth of every child rather than achievement and competition.
!!!! * Foster the idea of partnership in marriage and childrearing at all levels of education, stressing role equality and sharing of responsibility.
!!!! * Encourage all people by means of a Government-sponsored publicity campaign to avoid sex stereotyping in the rearing and education of children.

### Education at School
By the time children start school they have already been burdened with an enormous load of traditional masculine and feminine lore - how a man should behave, what a woman should be. Stereotyping is less blatant in the school system and is effected more by individual teachers and the pupils’ own peers than by the system itself. Nevertheless, education for girls differs in extent and substance from education for boys.

Girls observe that women predominate at the lower levels of the school system and man at the higher levels. They are more likely to have a male head of their school than a female. They do better academically at school than boys until puberty, yet leave school earlier with fewer qualifications. They take different subjects at secondary school. Fewer of them go on to tertiary education and again, those who do, take different subjects and degrees from those taken by most men.

Although in theory, educational opportunities are as available to girls as to boys, the assumptions made by pupils, teachers and parents seriously limit the girls’ education.

Boys know education is relevant to them: they know they will have to get a job and work most of their lives: they fear failure. School seems less relevant to a girl once she has been taught that her main interest is supposed to be in the home and her main aim is to attract a man. Failure is less important to her as there is always the escape route of marriage.

From the day she starts school to the day she leaves a girl can assume she will receive approval for what she Is (as an object) rather than for what she does (as a
subject).

Academic success can restrict the number of marriage partners available to her and so the motivation of older female students to achieve is less than that of their male peers.

Education at school will continue to be inadequate in preparing girls for careers and parenthood for as long as society fosters different expectations for each sex and the belief that sex roles must differ for men and women.

!!!! ####       The Values Party would
!!!! * Ensure that all trainee teachers received instruction in how to perceive and counteract sex stereotyping of their pupils.
!!!! * Encourage teachers to pay particular attention to motivating adolescent girls to achieve and to resist social pressures which could discourage them from training for possibly life-long careers,
!!!! * Attach pre-schools where possible to secondary schools to enable students of both sexes to be involved in practical family life education which completely avoided role stereotyping.
!!!! * Encourage more men to be involved in education ideally to reach a staff ratio of 50:50 with women at all levels.
!!!! * Eliminate sex bias from teaching materials and school books.
!!!! * Make all subjects, courses, sports facilities, and cultural amenities equally available to both sexes at all levels of education.
!!!! * Make co-educational schools the norm at all levels of schooling.
!!!! * Provide an integrated manual training scheme for all primary children.
!!!! * Amend social studies curricula to stress adequately the achievement of women, and the history of women as a social group.
!!!! * Promote opportunities for work experience in a wide range of occupations in a greater number of schools.
!!!! * Expand and improve the vocational guidance counselling service so that it does not channel girls into lower-paid, less responsible, less challenging work, or discourage boys from entering fields traditionally reserved for women.

### Education after schooling

Education for sex roles extends beyond school into adulthood and continues until death. As reality often does not match the expectations girls have about marriage or boys about work, adults of both sexes need constant assurances and admonitions to bolster up the crumbling walls of the old stereotypes. The mass media do a lot of role reinforcing.

Advertisements show passive, obliging, dependent women, always child-like, slim and decorative, often in competition with other women and envying them. Men are shown as strong, successful, able to own status symbols, admired by women, knowledgeable, cool and efficient.

It is ironic that a society which is so geared to sex roles makes such poor provision for the women whose opportunities for continuing education are restricted by childbearing and domestic responsibilities.

!!!! #### The Values Party would
!!!! * Discourage all advertising, especially on television, which undermined and insulted women's integrity, intelligence or sexuality.
!!!! * Disseminate more information about facilities and opportunities for continuing education.
!!!! * Provide more free education for adults especially those whose opportunities have been restricted by domestic responsibilities.
!!!! * Extend bursaries to part-time tertiary students.
!!!! * Article 23 [3] in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
!!!! > "everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ... ensuring an existence worthy of human dignity."
!!!! * That Government or community expenditure should be diverted towards paying for the essential care and cost of the sick, disabled, handicapped, old and young.

In the long term, a Values Government would implement a national minimum income scheme which would provide for actual payments to be made to those working usefully without proper remuneration by society, additional to the income which belonged to everyone by right (see Economics policy).

In the meantime, we believe that a fair wage, broadly graded according to actual work done and actual responsibility carried, should be paid by the State to every person irrespective of sex who works in the home or within the community caring part-time or full-time for a person who is partially or totally dependent for reasons of age and/or physical or mental health and who would otherwise be a charge upon the State. This wage would not include remuneration for any housework other than that generated by the dependants they are being employed to care for.

!!!! #### The Values Party believes
!!!! * Reasonable payments should be made to parents who by law and necessity are required to teach their own children under the guidance of the Correspondence School [children in remote areas who cannot be sent to school must be enrolled in the correspondence school by the age of seven, although most are enrolled at five and the mothers must act as unpaid teachers, spending about five hours a day super- vising and teaching them. About 600 New Zealand women are in this position.]
!!!! * The experience gained by persons in bringing up a family and in voluntary work should be taken into account where relevant by employers [especially the Public Service].
!!!! * Financial assistance should be given to individual voluntary workers in such form as tax exemptions for the use of private vehicles.
!!!! * Community centres should be established which could provide scope for voluntary bodies to strengthen and expand their activities which otherwise will diminish as improving employment conditions attract increasing numbers of women into alternative paid work.
### Childbirth and Health
The twentieth century has seen an enormous improve- ment in the health of women in most countries, primarily because of new birth control technology. Previously, many women spent most of their lives pregnant or breast feeding. They died early, their bodies worn out by continual childbirth - often they died in childbirth.

Their new freedom to choose parenthood or not has enabled women to seek more personal freedom in other areas of their lives too. For more detail on the relevance of the new birth control technology see the section on fertility control in the chapter “Individual Freedom”, (which deals with sex edxucation, contra- ception, sterilisation, and abortion).

Our policies on women's health are based on our belief that all persons should have as much say as possible over what happens to their bodies. 

We disapprove of the degree to which childbirth has been institutionalised and depersonalised.

!!!! #### The Values Party recommends
!!!! * More real attempts to prepare women in the techniques of natural childbirth and an overall humanising of the process.
!!!! * Re-education of all professions involved in the provision of obstetrical services to give real support and encouragement to women who want more control and understanding of their bodies during childbirth.
!!!! * That hospitals cease discriminating against single mothers in such matters as who they receive as visitors.
!!!! * Total revision of New Zealand maternity services giving mothers the first and last say.
!!!! * Support for the “pregnant patients” bill of rights at present being advocated throughout New Zealand.
!!!! * Better provision for home deliveries and for counselling in breast feeding.
!!!! * Medical research into women's health should receive at least the same degree of financial assistance as that into the area of general health. At present too many so-called “women's problems” are simply accepted as a fact of life, not to be remedied.
!!!! * The medical world not assume so often that women's specific health problems are neurotic in origin. This assumption may cause a doctor to be less sympathetic than should be expected and may in some cases result in inadequate treatment of the physical ailment.
!!!! * Measures be introduced towards achieving a balanced ratio of women in the medical and para-medical professions and at all decision-making levels in the health service.
!!!! * There be more health care counselling and referral services in clinics located in community centres.
!!!! * The cost of breast prostheses be included under Social Security as an artificial aid benefit.

We are concerned that the incidence of mental breakdown in New Zealand is substantially higher among women than men as evidenced by the high ratio of women to men in admittances to mental hospitals and the high proportion of women in total attempted suicides. 
>“Research .. has related this situation to depression caused by the pressures of domestic and social conditions on women, particularly those fully engaged in the home ... (and those) in the childbearing age group.” 
> Report of the NZ Select Committee on Women’s Rights, June 1975, p.81.

The Values Party believes
 all its policies on the status
of women would reduce these pressures
 and improve
these conditions.
Marriage and Divorce
The Values Party would discourage
 all practices
resulting from regulations,
 orders, stipulations, awards
and rulings which assume that women, especially
married women, have only dependent status or which
assume that women are financially irresponsible and
not credit-worthy or that breadwinners are necessarily
male (for example
 the Housing Corporation
 defines
 the
breadwinner
 as the male spouse if he is capable of
working).
The Values Party would
e Outlaw discrimination against women in the provision of all goods
and services including grants, mortgages, loans, credit finance,
banking and insurance facilities: in particular outlaw the practice of
requiring women wishing to undertake a financial commitment to
provide a male guarantor or the signature of a husband.
e Condense the Matrimonial Property Act, Domestic Proceedings Act
and Matrimonial Proceedings Act into one Domestic Act written with a
marriage
 contract
 attached
 as a schedule
 to it; this contract
 to set out
all legal obligations of each spouse.
¢ Amend legislation so that there be no obligation of one spouse to
support the other financially; their joint obligation to support children
to be set out, including procedures to be followed in the event of
separation. Another schedule would become operative if the couple
had a child or children and one partner stayed at home to care for
them.
e Amend the Domestic Actions Bill to support the abolition of actions
which treat women as chattels,
» Amend
 the law so that
 irreconcileable
 break-down
 of a marriage
would be the only grounds for divorce.
e Base divorce settlements on the principle that a couple should
generally be entitled to equal interest in matrimonial property
[especially a joint family home] whether each person's contribution
was in monetary form or not.
e Provide more legal aid for women whose husbands have far greater
financial resources and who are at a disadvantage when they face the
protracted legal proceedings which can follow from the application of
the matrimonial and domestic laws. Women should have the same
chance to state their case as a male breadwinner.
o Make sickness
 and unemployment
 benefits
 the same
 for married
persons of either sex as for single persons.
Maori Women
The Values Party is particularly concerned by the effect
of urbanisation on Maori women. Since 1971 the rate of
urbanisation has risen from 25 to 70 per cent of the
total.
Maori women
 marry younger,
 start
 bearing
 children
earlier, bear larger numbers
 of children,
 and stop
childbearing later.
Since
 Maori
 families
 are
 larger
 and
 their
breadwinners’
 wages lower, Maori women are
 being
forced to work at a crucial stage in their children’s lives
in order to supplement the family income. 24.7 per cent
(1971) of all married
 Maori women work. They tend to
be younger than their counterparts
 and they work
between
 pregnancies.
 Their earnings
 are extremely
 low
mainly because of the fact that 89 per cent of them
have no qualifications.
58
The Values Party believes that its policies on the
status of women and on race relations would greatly
reduce the social and economics pressures on maori
women.
Changing the law
Previous sections present policy to:
_ prevent the more blatant forms of discrimination
against women in New Zealand society;
- create a cultural environment where the equal
status of women and of traditional women’s values
can be achieved.
In addition to the provisions in policies given above,
general
 legislation
 is needed
 to bring New Zealand
 law
into conformity with international
 instruments
 relating
to the status of women.
Much of our law has developed from the basis of
Victorian male attitudes which were paternalistic and
protective towards women, relegating them to a
position of dependence. Such attitudes persist among
members of the public and cannot be changed
overnight but there is no reason for any delay in
altering all New Zealand
 laws developed
 on such an
unjustifiable
 basis. Such
 alterations
 will promote the
changes needed in attitudes throughout our society,
especially if complemented by educative action.
The Values Party would
e Examine,
 alter
 and add to all existing
 legislation
 with a view to
detecting and eliminating all legal disabilities of, and discrimination
against, persons on the basis of sex, marital status, or sexual
preference, and prescribe sanctions against discriminatory practices.
Machinery
 - is
 needed
 to
 enforce
 all
 such
 new
legislation,
e Set up an office similar to that of the ombudsman
 to examine
 and
remedy discrimination against persons on the basis of sex, marital
status, or sexual preference, in particular infringements of the Equal
Pay Act. Holders
 of office must
 have the power
 to prosecute
 and the
complainant should be able to approach them directly. Another
function of this office would be to inform and educate the public on the
implications of equality for women.
e¢ Recommend that all Government departments examine practices
which discriminate against persons on the basis of their sex, marital
status, or sexual preference, or which treat women in a paternalistic
manner.
e Support legislative amendments to the effect that in cases of rape,
the woman's sexual experience, apart from that with the person being
prosecuted, should not be admissible evidence - the complainant be
referred to only as Ms X; all names be suppressed until a conviction is
entered.
e Make provision in the Superannuation Act for women who do not
work for money [such as farmers’ wives].
e Extend the Joint Family Homes Act to cover farm houses.
Power
It is a fact that power in most of the forms that matter
in our society - in government, in commerce, in religion,
in community status - plus the power of wealth,
weapons, and the press is largely in men’s hands in
New Zealand.
e Ensure that more part-time tertiary courses were available and
that existing courses [for example at Massey] were better publicised.
e Provide more opportunity for parents returning to the work force to
train for a different occupation or to familiarise themselves with their
previous occupation.
® Establish more courses to give greater confidence to older parents
re-entering the workforce at technical institutes in the main cities.
e Encourage firms to retrain people in technical skills outside those
traditionally accepted as suitable for their sex.
e Establish a permanent system of education through television for
the benefit of home-bound spouses.
Employment of Women
The Values Party szes no reason in terms of inherent
qualities why a woman should not be able to undertake
any job for which she is qualified and to be successful in
that job. Yet historically
 women have been employed
 in
large numbers only when there is a shortage of male
workers
 or where
 it is cheaper
 to pay women
 than men.
New Zealand has a shortage of skilled labour which it
prefers to relieve by means of immigration. The Values
Party would however
 look to the vast segments
 of our
indigenous population which are employed below their
potential
 (and sometimes
 below their skill, particularly
when re-entering
 the workforce).
 Most of these are
women.
Women in employment
 are generally
 unskilled or
semi-skilled,
 doing jobs with minimal responsibility
 and
jobs which are mechanical, repetitive and boring (“that
men couldn't be expected to do’). The number of
occupations effectively open to women is limited - men
dominate factory, transport and agricultural jobs while
women hold by far the greatest proportion of clerical
and service jobs.
The Values Party would
e Eliminate separate labour markets for men and women.
e Prohibit the advertising of situations vacant in which sex is
specified even though irrelevant to the position.
Recommend
 all employers
 to:
- Place advertisements
 where both
 men and women
 will read them.
- Depict both men and women on the job in career literature.
- Reach both men and women on recruiting trips.
- Standardise interview practices for men and women applicants,
$0 that both are asked the same questions.
Equal pay
Over the last three
 censuses
 the annual
 median
income for female workers has been only half the level
for males. This will be somewhat
 improved when the
Equal Pay Act is fully implemented
 in 1977.
However, although equal pay has been in force for
years in the Public Service, women still occupy lower
rather than higher grades. Unless New Zealand is
careful
 its equal pay legislation
 could fail by default
 as
has happened elsewhere, especially with regard to the
effects of fringe benefits (such as gratuities,
low-interest
 home loans, medical and pension
schemes) and job reclassification on real earning
differentials.
59
The issue of equal pay is neatly side-stepped
 also in
fields where
 certain
 positions
 are
 always
 filled
 by
women.
The Values Party believes that in determining
 fair
rates
 of pay in occupations
 filled
 mainly
 by women,
notional male rates must be based on what employers
would have to pay male employees recruited from the
labour
 pool in any given region, and based
 also on job
evaluations which have been carried out scientifically
rather than by rule of thumb.
The Values Party would establish a public relations
campaign through the Labour Department to
e Allay the fears of both employers
 and employees
 regarding
 the
implications of the Equal Pay Act.
e Re-educate
 employers
 with
 outdated
 prejudiced
 attitudes
regarding
 the employment
 of women {for example
 “that
 men are more
committed to their work than women”).
o Make employers more aware of the advantages
 to themselves of
employing
 more
 women
 [for
 example,
 publicise
 the
 low female
turnover rate compared with that for males employed in freezing
works, the superior planting rates of women forestry workers, the
dexterity of women in occupations such as carpet-weaving].
e Seek trade union understanding and support for changes in the
pattern of women’s employment.
Conditions of work
Fair pay must be accompanied by fair conditions. The
reason some occupations, previously filled exclusively
by men, are now accepting
 women, is often because
 the
poor conditions _are not attracting
 enough male
applicants. In order to improve working conditions for
both men and women.
The Values Party would
o Apply protective
 legislation
 [for example
 regarding
 hours
 of work,
toilet and resting facilities, heavy lifting which might
 injure
employees] equally to both sexes where it was necessary.
e Remove
 from
 all
 orders,
 awards,
 industrial
 agreements
 and
statutory regulations any clauses of specific disadvantage to either
Sex.
e Require that policies of fringe benefits, leave entitlements,
marriage allowances, travel opportunities, job training, increased
responsibility, extra duties [for example, tea-making, shifting
furniture]
 and retirement
 age, affecting
 employees
 be extended
 to all
employees irrespective of sex.
Promotion
With regard
 to promotion
 opportunities
 and practices,
The Values Party would require that
o Employers
 consider
 all eligible
 applicants
 irrespective
 of their
 sex
for each promotion vacancy.
e Separate salary ceilings for men and women be eliminated.
e All transfer
 expenses
 and assistance
 including
 housing
 and costs of
moving family be equally available to both sexes.
® Employers
 levy no duties
 and
 make
 no demands
 [for example,
dress, behaviour, right to take a job] on the spouses of any of their
employees unless they are prepared to bring them into remunerative
employment on an ordinary part-time or casual basis [for example,
wives of diplomats, politicians, executives].
Making up the leeway
It will take some time before
 new promotion
 practices
alter the domination of men in executive positions and
the marked absence of women from senior positions
in all fields.
 Remedial
 measures
 are
 needed
 to help
women who have been employed for some time to
compensate for past lack of opportunity.
The Values Party would recommend that employers
eo Offer
 special in-service training
 and accelerated
 promotion
 to
women
 who have been
 held back by past policy.
e Endow women’s scholarships and traineeships
 in trades or
professions where women are under-represented [a special stress on
management training may be indicated].
e Credit women’s past service towards benefits for which they have
just been made eligible.
e Appoint a special staff member to deal with women’s interests until
the firm has eliminated discrimination.
e Educate all existing staff on intended changes in such a way that
acceptance and understanding is hastened.
e Set quotas
 of women
 in all occupations
 and promotional
 levels and
attempt to fill them [for example, by recruiting selectively in places
where women are to be reached].
Workers outside normal employment
Much valuable and productive work is done for society
by workers who receive no renumeration for their
work. In many cases such people are therefore forced
‘to become themselves dependent on the charity or
generosity of a friend, relative, spouse, or sexual
partner, despite the fact that they are healthy, sane,
adult and working both fulltime and overtime.
Hundreds of thousands of women are just such
workers, caring for dependants, supervising pupils of
the correspondence school, and doing voluntary social
work. The
 late
 Mr N. E. Kirk said
 (26.6.73)
 “If the
homemaker’s sister goes out to work, she gets paid at
the same rate as men. Where is the economic justice in
motherhood and for the homemaker?” Although jobs
done by women in normal employment are usually
socially lower-rated and less prestigious, the job of
housewife
 is at the bottom
 of the pile - very low social
status,
 no
 leave,
 no
 sickness
 benefit,
 no
superannuation,
 and no income-related
 accident
compensation (though the home is eight times as
dangerous
 as a farm and six times
 as dangerous
 as a
factory).
Society praises the role of the mother in nurturing
and caring for her family yet fails to give her any real
support in performing this function and penalises her
for the rest of her life for having done it. Even the most
unskilled full-time paid job carried occupational
benefits in contrast to which the housewife caring for
dependants, on whose physical and mental resources
enormous demands are made, is in the unique position
of having no call on standard
 conditions
 of employment.
The Values Party believes that whatever role a
woman chooses it should be freely chosen on the basis
that it will not place her at any disadvantage
 compared
with other sections of the community.
We endorse these principles
e That every person irrespective of sex who does socially useful work
should receive a fair living wage.
All magistrates
 (bar
 one)
 and
 judges,
 almost
 all
ministers
 of religion, business
 executives
 and
university professors, most academics and profession-
als, most of the armed forces and mass media, and
most of the owners of resources in New Zealand are
men.
Women are for the most part absent from union
meetings, trade councils and the annual conference of
the Federation of Labour. They have always been
totally absent from the National Executive of the
Federation of Labour, and the teams representing New
Zealand
 at the annual
 I.L.O. Conferences.
In our parliament, 83 out of 87 seats are held by men,
yet men are only 48.7 per cent of the population. There
were
 no women
 in parliament
 at all until 1933
 even
though women got the vote in 1893 and have been able
to stand for Parliament since 1919.
 |
The Values Party would
e Promote measures to ensure more women applicants are
appointed to public office, especially with regard to judicial and
magisterial appointments.
e Revise the Juries Act with a view to putting jury service for women
on a par with jury service for men.
e Encourage all clubs and other organisations to provide access to
their facilities to women on the same basis as for men, where sex does
not justify exclusion.
» Recommend that all political parties give special encouragement
and special assistance to female candidates to help them overcome
difficulties and prejudices and that they select all candidates on merit
regardless of sex.
e Urge the Federation of Labour and all Trade Unions to promote
actively the full participation of women at all levels of trade union
activity.
e Encourage the full participation of women
 at all levels
 of
decision-making in all sectors of society.
