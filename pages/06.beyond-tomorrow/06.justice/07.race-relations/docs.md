The Values Party believes that the determination of
Maori Affairs should be largely in the hands of Maori
people.
Values Party
 policies that would affect Maori people
incorporate
 this
 principle.
 (Refer:
 Education,
Government
 Reform, Crime, Status
 of Women,
Individual Rights.) As Values’ policies develop in other
fields they will also incorporate this principle.
Maori problems are frequently the problems of lower
socio-economic
 groups. Our economics policy has been
developed so that it will attack these problems at their
fundamental,
 economic level.
Assimilation or Integration?
New Zealand prides itself on a record of racial harmony
and this pride is justified when New Zealand is
compared with the situations in (for example) South
Africa, Australia, and the United States. But relative to
the goals of equal opportunity and equal achievement,
racial equity and harmony in New Zealand is similar to
the relationship between a shark and a terakihi.
New Zealand's history with respect to the Maori
people is by and large one of exploitation and
land-grabbing, of inadequate services especially for
introduced social problems in health and education, of
emasculation
 of maori tradition
 and culture.
 Dick
Scott’s recent
 book, Ask that Mountain,
 gives an
account of one episode in this history.
Present generations are not to blame for this history,
but do share a responsibility to help redress its
injustices. It makes no sense to claim that because we
are not to blame
 we should
 do nothing
 about
 it.
pakeha world. Why he is not is also clear: the drift to
the cities has tended to erode his social and cultural
institutions and thus the sense of personal identity
from which he previously derived his mental stability
and satisfactions.
The Values Party will do everything
 it can towards
remedying the disadvantages
 that many Maori people
are facing.
Pakeha society has tried to assimilate the Maori; it
has tried to turn him into a brown-skinned
 European.
Education and court appearance
 statistics
 show the
extent of failure.
Assimilation
 has created
 much personal
 unhap-
piness. Witi lhimaera’s
 story One Step
 Forward
 is Two
Steps Back gives an insight into the sort of problems
faced by the two-headed
 people, the pakeha
 Maori.
Today, when most Maori
 live in urban areas,
 these
human problems assume even greater proportions.
The task ahead
 is not to assimilate
 the Maori but to
foster his racial and cultural identity. We must
strengthen maori institutions, not legislate them out of
existence.
 Maori institutions
 that are strong,
 respected,
and accepted by the pakeha majority could contribute
to the well-being of the nation, by preserving the Maori
culture and its alternative values and satisfactions, and
by re-integrating into maori society a number of its
members, especially in the younger age groups, who
are dissident and alienated.
In undertaking
 to do everything
 possible to
encourage development of the richness and value of
maori tradition
 and culture, the Values Party
recognises that there is much in maori tradition and
62
culture that pakeha could learn to their own benefit.
For example, from traditional maori approaches to
community, co-operation, work, land and decision-
making. It is time that all in New Zealand tried to make
maori traditions their own to some extent (as maori
people have done with pakeha traditions).
The Values Party would
e Work towards effective integration
 by:
- allowing the Maori people to foster their own institutions
 in their
Own ways;
- enriching and transforming New Zealand society by learning from
maori traditions and culture.
e Adopt short-term policies for achieving healthy integration:
- make land and finance readily available for urban marae;
- introduce thorough race relations training for police recruits and
employers, and support unions which promote courses for
“nimigrant Polynesian workers.
- investigate the practicability of a separate Magistrates’ Court
system for Maori and Polynesians, involving among other features a
Polynesian judiciary;
- phase out such groups as the Task Force in favour of increased
support for trained welfare officers, wardens, and J-Teams [prefer-
ably Maori or other
 Polynesians]
 working
 in major cities.
Maori Land
The Values Party believes that if traditional maori
attitudes to the land had been allowed to develop
instead of being broken down by the traditional
European attitude, New Zealand would be in a far
healthier
 state than it is. Obviously,
 neither
 attitude
 is
sufficient for today's interdependent
 society.
In many important respects Values’ land policy - that
the use and administration of land be placed under
community
 control
 through
 co-operative
 and
participatory procedures - is closer to the traditional
maori attitude then to the traditional European
attitude.
The Values Party advocates that existing Maori lands
wherever possible remain in maori proprietorship.
A multiracial-multicultural
 society
New Zealand's
 race relations
 problems
 have been both
deteriorating and widening in recent years. Immigrants
from the Pacific Islands and Europe find themselves
faced
 with
 intolerance
 and
 prejudice.
 Often
 only lip
service is paid to the concepts
 of individual freedom
and interdependence.
The Values Party support the concept of integration
that emphasises the need for particular ethnic groups
to develop
 and
 live out their
 own cultural
 identity.
There can be no effective integration in New Zealand
until the different cultures are each viable in their own
right and each willing to integrate.
The Values Party
o Believes that many of the policies it has developed in other areas
will apply here. Tolerance and goodwill can hardly be legislated, but
bigotry and discrimination
 can and will be penalised.
e Recognises the contribution
 of all racial groups in the development
of a truly integrated multiracial society. It would support the efforts of
such groups to retain their cultural identity. All immigrant groups face
serious problems in coping with an alien society. Frequently the
problems that arise can be traced to difficulties in communication.
e¢ Would seek to establish better channels of communication between
representatives of ethnic minorities and all levels and agencies of
government.
e Recognise
 the need for institutional
 and local protection
 for the
cultural rights of all groups.
