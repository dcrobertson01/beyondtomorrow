Crime and Punishment
There is a growing awareness in society that those who
offend against its laws should be removed from the
community only as a last resort. This is because the
chances for successful rehabilitation are less in the
unnatural environment of the prison than they are in
the community.
Where a law-breaker is given some form of imprison-
ment or detention the only punishment inflicted by
society should be the deprivation of freedom, for
freedom is one of the most valued of human rights.
Our penal institutions, and especially our medium
and maximum security prisons, have one basic
weakness -- they not only deprive inmates of their
freedom but tend to deprive them of their self-
respect
 and humanity
 .as well.
Government policies should be shaped by the
guiding principle that the life of prison inmates should
be as normal and as uplifting as is possible within the
restrictive confines of a penal institution. Only in an
environment of normalcy can the difficult process of
rehabilitation
 begin. Character
 reform is almost
impossible in the debasing environment
 of many
prisons.
Such environments
 actually increase the maladjust-
ment of criminals by uncovering and worsening
personality weaknesses. Self-respect is assailed,
initiative is curbed. Dress, food, reading, getting up and
going to bed are no longer matters of choice. The
inmate cannot fulfill his role as a worthwhile human
being
 to parents,
 wife, children
 or friends.
 He is as
unproductive
 and dependent as a child.
By taking the prisoner's freedom and then reducing
his responsibility almost to vanishing point, society
makes the inmate less fit than ever to comply with the
demands
 and
 pressures
 of modern
 life when
 he is
released. Many ex-inmates, when asked which was the
worst - going to prison for the first time or coming out
of prison upon release - have commented that it was
the latter. The sudden
 change
 from one style of life to
an infinitely more complex and demanding
 one
produces great psychological disturbance.
 Indeed,
some prison reformers do not consider that a man is
responsible for his actions after his release from
prison, as he is in a profound state of shock. To them
recidivism (returning to prison) may be seen, not as a
failure of the individual to be rehabilitated, but as a
failure of the individual to recover from the shock.
Instead he simply returns to prison where he has
identity and acceptance.
Total abolition of prisons may not be desirable, but
imprisonment should be reserved for only the most
uncontrollable and dangerous criminals. Most of those
presently in our gaols are not in this category.
An immediate start should be made on developing
new alternatives to prison, apart from the present
64
alternatives of probation, periodic detention, and fines.
Simultaneously
 steps
 should
 be taken
 by
government to make remaining prisons as congenial
and normal as possible in order to reduce unrest and
aid rehabilitation.
The
 policy
 outlined
 below
 will
 deal
 firstly
 with
improving present prison conditions, contemplating no
movement to ‘open’ institutions, and secondly, with
possible alternatives to prisons.
Prison Conditions
Pay Rates
A determined effort must be made to increase the
sense of purpose and responsibility of inmates. This
can best be done in New Zealand prisons by providing
prisoners with proper jobs and paying them: realistic
wages so that they can pay a realistic amount towards
board and lodgings, pay off debts, contribute towards
the maintenance of any dependants, and save up sums
in preparation for use on release.
At the present time the poor payment in prison is not
conducive to enthusiastic work. Payment to the prison-
er is only in the nature of pocket money while any
dependants go on Social Security.
In many of our prisons, especially the medium
security institutions, prisoners have barely enough
work to keep them occupied, and when reasonable jobs
are provided there is little incentive to work because of
the ridiculous pay rates.
Productive work habits are an essential part of the
shaping of a man and the teaching of work discipline is
of particular
 importance
 in the
 life of the
 offender,
because it decreases his feelings of restlessness
 and
worthlessness which come with idleness.
In 1966 the Justice Department stated that it hoped
to introduce award rates of payment into prisons, but
the proposed reform has never eventuated. Instead the
Government
 is adhering to the ‘pocket money”
concept and periodically raising the pay scale a few
cents.
There are a number of administrative and bureau-
cratic difficulties involved with this system of payment
but none that a determined government could not
overcome.
Attempts
 should
 be made to increase
 the
responsibility of inmates in other areas of prison
activity and administration.
Humanising Influences
In an attempt to recreate a normal social environment
within the prisons, a number of reforms should be
introduced. Homely furnishings should be used as
widely as possible; there should be greater attention to
the provision
 of grassed
 exercise
 yards
 (all exercise
yards at Paremoremo Prison are paved); there could be
regular small liquor rations for inmates who imbibe and
who are not suffering from alcoholism; a variety of
dress and clothing should be allowed, and there should
be greater flexibility in timetable in order to reduce the
monotony
 of prison life.
Interaction with the Community
A high priority should be given to measures to increase
interaction between the prison and the community.
Prison visiting, at present encouraged by a voluntary
organisation (the Prisoners’ Aid and Rehabilitation
Society) needs to be increased, with persons willing to
“adopt” prisoners. These people can provide inmates
with deep contacts with the outside community. At the
present time many prisoners receive no visitors.
A scheme to encourage reformed inmates to take
part in a visiting programme should also be considered.
According to reports, ex-inmates returning to prison
can have a profound effect on criminals - seeing one of
their own kind volunteering to help them. In borstals
this could be good as trainees are usually too impatient
of authority to take notice of anyone connected with the
“‘establishment”.
There should be an expansion of the home-leave
scheme to allow inmates other than first offenders to
receive leave. At the present time adult inmates
serving their first sentence of imprisonment may be
granted up to three days home leave plus travelling
time, once every four months. It is generally restricted
to married
 inmates.
 The scheme
 should
 be open to all
categories of offenders with the principle criterion for
home
 leave
 being
 the
 likely threat
 to public
 safety.
Home leave should also be allowed far more frequently
than at present.
Regular. supervised telephone calls by inmates, to
families, friends, and relatives, should also be allowed.
The possibility of allowing supervised group outings
of trustworthy
 inmates to rugby matches, rock
concerts, and selected amusements, should also be
examined.
Overcrowding
Many penal institutions,
 especially of a medium
security nature, are badly overcrowded, and more
accommodation
 and better facilities are urgently
needed. A Justice Department publication “Crime and
the Community’, said several years ago that there had
been understandable
 public reluctance to spend
money on institutions, and referred to “public indiffer-
ence”. The book's author must surely have known that
the public will never provide a lead on penal reform
and that a poor prison system is the product of govern-
mental indifference and expediency.
Instead
 of building
 large
 centres
 like Paremoremo,
small ones should be constructed to provide for
different
 types of sentences,
 age-groups,
 and
categories of inmates, and to avoid the impersonality of
large institutions.
Adjustment
Care must be taken to reduce the shock of transition
from prison to the community.
At the present time there are pre-release hostels
designed to fulfill this function. They are provided
mainly for borstal detainees, but there are pre-release
hostels for adults in Christchurch and Auckland. There
is an urgent need for a pre-release hostel in Wellington
to help the adjustment of inmates at the medium
security prison at Mt Crawford.
Post-release hostels exist in various centres to assist
the adjustment of inmates but the number of these
should be increased.
Prison Staff
A penal system can only be as good as the men and
women who serve as prison officers.
Tim Shadbolt, in his book “Bullshit and JellybeansTM,
stated that:
.. ‘prison guards are important people in a prison.
They're examples of what a prisoner should aspire to.
They are the only examples the prisoners have of a
good law-abiding citizen. They are society's ambassad-
ors to the criminal world. If . . . prison guards and
prisons are no good, then the prisoners think that the
rest of society is no good either.”
A one-year
 Certificate
 in Criminology course
 is
offered
 at Auckland
 University
 but
 only five
 prison
officers out of 550 are selected annually to attend the
course. As Shadbolt said: “Improvements made on
such a small scale - but when the need is so great - are
no more than a bad joke".

Alternatives to Prison
The suggestion
 that prisons
 can be all but completely
eliminated without increasing the danger to the com-
munity, is not as fanciful as it may sound.
A study group for the Governor of Wisconsin
 recently
recommended
 that
 all adult
 prisons
 in the
 State
 be
closed by this year.
An increasing number of penologists believe that the
prison system must be phased
 out because
 it has
proved
 unable to rehabilitate
 criminals.
 A Harvard
 law
professor, James Vorenberg, said recently: “You have
just got to close prisons down, but you've got to
develop-some real alternatives’.
A number
 of countries
 and some
 states
 in the USA
are
 presently
 experimenting
 with
 imaginative .
alternatives.
Massachusetts
In Massachusetts
 since
 1969
 all
 juvenile
 training
schools (the equivalent of our borstals and youth
detention
 centres)
 have been abolished. Young
offenders are rechanelled into:-
- Group homes where eight to 12 youths live with an
adult couple under supervision
 by local agencies (at
greatly reduced cost per capita to the State than under
the old “training school” system);
- Foster Homes;
- Their own homes, under a “buddy” system where a
university student spends 20 to 25 hours a week with
the delinquents;
- Qutdoor activities such as cleaning up parklands and
going on pack and survival trips.
Florida
The State of Florida has begun putting convicts into
small suburban hostels on the theory that the isolation
of prisons is one of their biggest weaknesses.
The hostels are spacious and have a relaxed and
open atmosphere,
 with the men working in the
community during the day and being allowed normal
facilities and rights, such as television and air
conditioners in their rooms, and visitors of either sex
every
 evening
 until
 10pm with all day visits
 allowed
during the weekend.
Carolina pioneered
 such centres
 15 years ago and
now
 has 63
 of them.
 Released
 inmates
 have
 an
incredibly low reconviction rate of less than two per
cent. This compares with a reconviction rate of about
20 per cent for Witako, New Zealand's
 most enlighten-
ed adult penal institution, and a rate of about 60 per
cent to 70 per cent for inmates released from our
medium and maximum security prisons.
Denmark
The Ombudsman, Sir Guy Powles, has drawn attention
to a Danish “prison”, the Herstevester
 institution,
which is both open and maximum security in nature. It
66
was strikingly successful, he said.
The evidence seems to suggest that in locking the
criminal
 away and treating
 him as if he is dangerous,
society is encouraging the very behaviour it seeks to
eliminate. The overseas experiments suggest that if a
society is bold enough to give the criminal an amount of
“controlled freedom’ or “relaxed captivity” which
fosters
 responsibility
 instead
 of
 eliminating
 it,
significant behavioural change does take place.
The Values Party would
e Make an immediate start on the gradual phasing out of most New
Zealand prisons and their replacement by a large number of small
“open”
 suburban
 hostels
 for all except prisoners
 requiring
 treatment
for psychiatric disorders.
e Ensure that every prisoner retained the right to vote at national
elections.
e Phase out imprisonment for most crimes against property, and
replace it with community service, the offender being required to
make good the loss or damage wherever appropriate.
While closed prisons are in existence the following
measures should be implemented -
e The provision
 of adequate
 and suitable
 work for all inmates.
e Award wages in order to provide an incentive work, and fo help
inmates maintain their dependants and save up sums for use on
release.
e Greater humanising influences introduced to prisons, such as
homely furniture and decorations, grassed exercise areas, regular
small liquor rations, variety in clothing, greater flexibility of prison
timetable, and a prison cinema.
e¢ Encouragement of prison visiting.
e Expansion of home-leave scheme to other than first-termers.
e Regular supervised telephone calls by inmates to relatives, family
and friends.
e Supervised group outings of inmates fo sports matches, rock
concerts, and other amusements.
e Immediate construction of a pre-release hostel for Wellington.
o Greatly expanded provisions for prison officers to take the
Certificate and Diploma courses in Criminology at Auckland
University.
