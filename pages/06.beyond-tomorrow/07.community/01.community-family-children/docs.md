“In the older forms of social organisation, it was just
this inescapable fact of close interdependence
 that
held the family and the community together. In village
or town, the lives of the inhabitants were dominated by
local events. Narrow though their lives might appear by
our standards they had, young and old, their place in
the natural order of things, a settled relationship to one
another guided by a network of custom and mutual
obligation.
 Inevitably
 then, they were all of them
 part of
the prior and absorbing concern of the community they
dwelt in.”
E. J. Mishan, “Growth: The Price We Pay’,
Staples Press 1969.
The simple fact is that in our quest for economic
security we have paid too much attention to satisfying
our material needs and not enough to creating a
healthy social environment
 to meet our deeper,
non-material needs.
Two important
 changes
 in social
 organisation
 took
place as a result of the striving for affluence which
grew out of the depression.
 Firstly people came
together to service technology and the result was the
creation of large, badly-planned urban areas. Secondly,
the family unit was reduced to the bare minimum as it
struck
 out on its own to find the “good life”.
The result is that communities
 have become too big
and families too small.
A natural characteristic of mass societies in a tech-
nological age is that they tend towards shallowness and
artificiality in human relations.
Because of the sprawling nature of cities and towns,
the formation of small areas with a community of
interest is a rare phenomenon. Sociologists say that
once we pass the level of the village we reach a point of
social organisation that has not often been achieved by
the human species.
If a society grows too large the bonds holding it
together become progressively weaker and eventually
disintegrate. It is significant that a recent study in
America has revealed that the crime rate appears to be
proportionate to the size of a city. Violent crime per
capita increases with size.
It is difficult to create sound societies when people
are constantly moving from place to place. in such
conditions the towns are not made up of people who
have grown up together and among whom bonds have
had time to develop, but simply of people who have
been thrown together for various random reasons.
The fact that people's places of work are generally
situated outside their communities also tends to impair
the growth of a close community of interest.
Fostering Community
What New Zealand badly needs
 is a set of clearly
defined national goals with which the whole community
can identify and which address
 themselves
 to
improving and using the non-economic capacities of
the population.
Increasingly, as economic security becomes routinely
obtainable, the attention of the community should be
focussed on more challenging and uplifting goals such
as the regeneration and enrichment of community
involvement and human relationships. Debate should
be encouraged
 by the government
 at all levels to get
the community involved in the formulation of national
goals. This would be indicative planning of a
revolutionary nature.
Decentralised government is also valuable because it
helps to foster a sense of community. This feeling of
kinship and interdependence,
 whether at the suburb
level, the neighbourhood level, or the person-to-person
level, has great possibilities
 for modifying the
impersonal
 natures
 of societies
 like ours
 which
 are
urbanised, competitive, materialistic and filled with
technology which tends to separate people.
Before the drift to the cities began in New Zealand,
and before the three bedroom house, the quarter acre
section and the other symbols.of guaranteed happiness
became the dominant goal of the average New
Zealander, households tended to be quite large.
In rural areas or low-density towns and cities, grand-
parents,
 unmarried
 brothers
 and sisters,
 and
sometimes even an aunt or an uncle were part of the
family circle. Then, within a short space of time,
complex social and economic forces stripped the family
to its basic number - parents and children - and caused
a reduction in the number of desired offspring.
The result was the “nuclear
 family” - the unit of
father
 and mother
 and children
 (average
 about
 2.5).
This unit is a handy size for consumerism and its
mobility is an asset to employers. However, many social
observers
 now say that the nuclear
 family, living in a
self-contained and isolated house in the suburbs, may
not be the healthiest environment for parents and
children. Technological society draws the members of
the modern family outward and disrupts the stability
that both children and adults need. Jobs, careers,
school,
 friends,
 differing
 values
 and
 morals,
 and
 all
kinds of social institutions and technologies impinge on
the fragile family unit. The suburban
 household
becomes little more than a place to sleep.
The distorted quality of the family environment
cannot be the subject of very penetrating political or
governmental action. Governments can endeavour to
provide families with good housing and good education
and welfare services, but they cannot and should not
tinker with the family unit.
Only through
 natural
 evolution
 and
 individual
experimentation
 will the modern family adapt itself to
69
the conditions of a technological society. If it becomes
widely accepted that larger families are more desirable,
it is to be hoped that the nuclear family will be
extended by the addition of grandparents
 and
relatives, rather than through an increase in the
number of offspring. As has been pointed out, the
ecological arguments in favour of slowing and even
halting population growth are very powerful.
Communal living experiments which draw together
two or three families under one large roof are much in
evidence in our larger cities, especially among the
younger generation, and seem to be very successful.
They may be a guide for future
 social change.
Child-rearing
Family living
 and
 parenthood
 classes
 should
 be
introduced
 into
 the
 education
 system.
 With
 the
increasing
 trend
 of parents
 to have only two or three
children - usually in quick succession - many young
adults have their first experience of child care only
when they have their first child. The view of many
child-care experts is that this situation can be a
dangerous one - mainly for the baby.
The causes of crime are frequently traceable to poor
family environments
 and broken marriages. One
reason for poor family environments is that families in
New
 Zealand
 are
 an
 economically
 disadvantaged
minority. They are a minority because 75 percent of the
new generation are being raised in only a third of the
country’s households.
The cost of bringing up children takes 75-80 per cent
of the wage-packet, placing a huge burden on the
worker parent, with welfare benefits in no way
reflecting the cost of providing for a child. The
introduction of equal pay has created pressure on the
family with a single breadwinner and we can expect a
widening in the gap in living standards
 between
 a one
and two income family.
What is required is a re-deployment of labour and
economic resources back into our most important
social enterprise - the bearing and rearing of children.
This
 does
 not
 conflict
 with
 our
 party's
 policy
 of
population
 control
 provided
 that
 our society
implements the measures we advocate with regard to
family planning and responsible parenthood. (See
chapter on individual freedom.)
Economic injustice for child-rearers is not justifiable
as a method of limiting population growth. Every
society needs and wants some children and if it is
civilised and wise, should make the best provision it
can for their rearing. We therefore need to give home-
makers the power to improve the conditions in which
they work - economic power. If homemakers were paid
an adequate rate for the job, they would have economic
power to re-structure society to cater better for the
needs of children and families. (See policy on wage for
dependant-carers
 in chapter on the status of women.)
To make the life of the homemaker
 comparable
 to other
workers more labour must be brought into the
domestic sector to relieve the homemaker. The most
desirable and most natural auxiliary labour force is the
breadwinning parent.
Varying Work Patterns
It is customary in New Zealand for children under five
to be reared almost entirely by their mothers. This is a
very new child-rearing pattern and is not found in many
other societies throughout history. Society needs to
work at new attitudes and relationships between
mothers and fathers in both family and working life.
Variations in work patterns would give them the
chance to share “home” and “breadwinning” so that
both parents could spend time with their families.
The present work pattern is still geared to the needs
of male employees in the role of breadwinners,
reflecting values'and attitudes which are incompatible
with modern realities. Most employers have given little
serious attention to adopting procedures geared to the
typical life pattern
 of the career
 parent.
As long as this is so, women,
 unlike men, will often
have to choose either a career or parenthood.
Meanwhile men who would like to make use of new
opportunities to share the responsibility for home and
children with their wives find it very difficult to adapt
their own work pattern.
One helpful innovation would be a change in the
nature of part-time work. At present this is often poorly
paid and rarely provides any fringe benefits such as
lunch and tea breaks or sick and holiday leave.

The Values Party
 recommends
 that
e Employers consider making more use of part-time workers
especially at peak hours or as an alternative to overtime.
o Employers experiment with such variations in normal work
patterns as twilight shifts and glide-time [all employees work a core
period and work the remaining time at the convenience of themselves
and their employers]; outwork [for already trained persons who can
work without supervision]; provision for dual-career families; and
various kinds of split-work or job-sharing [for example, a student and
a housespouse sharing the same job].
Child Care Support
In 1971 the Department of Labour estimated that
there were 35 - 40,000 pre-school children of working
mothers but day-care facilities for only 2,000. In June
1974 there were facilities for 2781. What is happening
to the other 30,000 children?
Most social workers know the human cost of
inadequate private arrangements for child-minding -
“‘door-key’ children, children locked out, neglect and
over-crowding.
The Values Party does not see child-care centres
merely as child-minding establishments. They can be
important supplements for the education, experience
and contact with other people which the home is able
to provide young children, whether both parents work
or not.
There is little to indicate that the isolation of pre-
school children and mothers in suburbs is conducive to
the mental health of either. Some parents may be
well-fitted to cope with this pattern and some children
may spend most of their waking hours for five years
with the same parent and still thrive. Other parents do
not cope, their children do not thrive, and society picks
up the broken pieces.
Unremitting contact with very young children can
cause almost anyone great stress. No parent who is
unable or unwilling to care for a child should be forced
to do so by the lack of an alternative - both child and
parent suffer. Traditional alternatives in the form of
relatives and neighbours who could give parents in the
home a break from their children are rapidly becoming
unavailable.
Another function of child-care centres is to enable all
parents to have more choices about personal fulfilment
and community service. It is very narrow to consider
that only parents who are forced to work because of
financial need should use child-care centres. Other
good reasons include further education and training,
voluntary work, creative or sporting pursuits, or mental
stress.
This is not to say that parents should be actively
encouraged to place young children in communal care
but simply that each family should decide what is best
for all its members.
Child-care centres should share the same basic aim
as all organisations
 and people who are concerned
 with
pre-school children - to ensure that all children get the
love, education
 and opportunities
 they need to grow ye
into healthy, happy, responsible adults.
The Values Party would
o Foster community support and social conditions that enabled both
men and women to combine parenthood with employment if they
chose to do this.
e Ensure that day-care and over-night facilities for parents and young
children were available to all who required them, including rural
families.
e Ensure that all child-care facilities were well-staffed and
well-equipped and that incentives were provided to encourage
professional staff to stay as long as possible at the same centre.
e Amend the Child Care Regulations 1960 along the lines suggested
by the NZ Association of Child Care Centres some 18 months ago.
e Encourage community involvement in child-care centres [for
example, by welcoming parents, school-children, and older people as
helpers].
¢ Vest government responsibility for the provision and maintenance
of child-care facilities with the Education Department rather than
with Social Welfare as at present, in order to emphasise
developmental rather than custodial considerations.
e Provide loans for the establishment of child-care centres on the
same basis as other pre-school institutions, assist with providing
approved equipment, and provide training at Teachers’ College level
for child-care centre staff.
e Pay salaries for trained staff in State-provided centres and
subsidise the wages of staff in approved voluntary centres or
approved centres provided by private firms.
eo Assist voluntary or municipal organisations
 providing residential
and recreational services for the care of children, especially holiday
camps and after-school activities.
e Encourage the use of school buildings out of school hours for
after-school child-care, the responsibility for such care being
undertaken by the Council for Sport and Recreation under the
supervision of the Department of Education.
eo Require
 that
 all workers
 who are parents
 be entitled
 to use sick
leave to care for sick children or sick spouses with dependants.
e Provide home help for hospitalised single parents and for parents
who for reasons of work need help in the home when one or other of
them is hospitalised.
e Encourage hospitals and health centres to provide child-care
facilities and some overnight accommodation for staff and visitors.
o Encourage hospitals to provide rooming-in facilities for the parents
of pre-school children.
o Expect employers to reduce demands made on senior employees
which extend regularly or suddenly into private time so that children
are unduly deprived of the executive parent.
