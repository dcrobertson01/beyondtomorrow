Welfare
The Values Party's policies on economics, technology,
community development, education and health are
fundamental
 to our welfare
 policy.
An objective of all Values policies is to create the kind
of society in which there is no need for social welfare as
itis traditionally understood. Traditional social welfare
should rather be carried out in the normal course of
community interaction.
Basic to this objective are our policies on the redist-
ribution of income, wealth and opportunity. Our
concept of a guaranteed minimum income adequate for
living needs and available from current production,
would replace most benefits and superannuation
schemes.
Superannuation
Superannuation has become a political football, with
the main parties focussing on what each scheme will
cost the taxpayer and what each person can expect to
get. The only good feature of the present bickering is
that it is one of the few signs that either party can look
further than three years ahead.
The Values Party rejects the whole idea of a separate
superannuation
 scheme, which implies that when
citizens reach a set age they are turned-out into a
special pasture. Senior citizens are still people - who
have not only contributed to society but who still have a
lot to contribute. They should be part of our total
economic structure and not a separate compartment.
Our minimum
 income policy, would always be geared
to the current cost of living. The level would be high
enough
 to
 make
 privately
 funded
 schemes
unnecessary.
The section on economics
 has more detail on policy in
this area.
The Values Party
e Sees its objective as ensuring that the total payment received is
adequate to maintain dignity and well-being.
e Believes that Social Security should apply not only to those in
sickness, hardship, unemployment or old age, but also to solo parents,
parents of handicapped children, home workers, and the lowly-paid.
Such social security would apply until Values’ redistribution policies
came into full effect.
e Would not alter existing rate, telephone and television rebates for
the elderly, or child benefit allowances.
e It would seek to liberalise regulations governing the permissible
income of beneficiaries.
Preventive Welfare
The 1972 Values Party manifesto
 emphasised
preventive rather than supportive social welfare. We
suspect that traditional problem-orientated social wel-
fare merely reinforces existing problems of division and
isolation of people from the community, while
maintaining rather than attacking the forces that
created the need for outside help.
7/8
We nevertheless recognise that there will be a
continuing need for traditional forms of social welfare.
We believe that the policies we are evolving to meet
these needs can also be a means of altering the
direction and focus of social welfare. As we said in 1972
the Values Party seeks to change the system so it
meets the needs of people instead of changing people
to meet the needs of the system.
The Values Party feels that many of our welfare
needs arise from the effects of the nuclear family
lifestyle. Our industrial relations, housing, land, town
planning,
 and environment
 policies would all have the
effect of carrying through our general policy of encour-
aging the development of alternative lifestyles.
There should be an expansion of ‘common situation”
groups like Alcoholics Anonymous and Solo Parents
Inc., bringing people together to discuss changes in
their lives. People who have moved house many times
have some wisdom to impart to those who are moving
for the first time. Divorced people can help those who
are still caught
 in divorce
 proceedings.
 People who are
promoted, demoted, who have gained a child or lost a
spouse, can be helped to make the transition by simply
being able to talk with others who have been there
before them.
The Values Party would
e¢ Decentralise
 the
 monolithic Social Welfare Department
 on a
regional and community basis. [Our proposals for changes to the
administration of education provide a model.]
e Increase support for voluntary, locally-based social and community
workers, especially in rural areas. This support would include positive
steps to meet training needs.
e Seek to establish agencies for co-ordinating requests for aid and
service at the community level where such agencies do not exist
already, and support them where they do. We see considerable
advantage in locating such agencies close to similar ones proposed in
health and education.
