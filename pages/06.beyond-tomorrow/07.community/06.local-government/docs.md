Local Government
Participatory democracy requires that decisions be
made at the lowest practicable level. For too long local
bodies have been concerned with just drains, roads
and footpaths. We think they should be equally
concerned with the wider social needs of the
community which have to date been left to a distant
bureaucracy.
Acquisition of new powers by local government is
required especially in the social field, with a
consequent reduction in the functions and size of
central government
 (see “Government
 Reform’).
Decentralisation
 of the control of housing, health,
welfare and education
 to regional bodies will ensure
that these services would react more readily to local
needs and that those directly affected by such services
will have a greater
 say in their management.
Organisation
There
 are 670 local bodies
 and ad hoc authorities
 in
New Zealand. The boundaries
 for most have been
drawn
 on historical
 bases
 which
 are now well out of
date. Powers and duties often overlap, and there is an
absence of any coherent planning and coordination.
The Values Party would
e Support
 the rationalisation
 of local bedies
 into Regional
 Councils,
District or City Councils and Community Councils as envisaged in the
Local Government
 Act, 1974.
e Encourage the establishment of ward systems for those city and
district councils where such a system does not already exist.
e Bring Harbour Boards under the control of regional government.
e Abolish the ratepayers’ poll, so that the only qualification for voting
at local body elections
 becomes
 a residential
 one.
Finance
Almost all local body revenues are raised by a system of
rating on property. This system is an archaic remnant
of the Land Taxes which were the source of practically
all government
 revenue
 in colonial
 days.
 Rates
 are
inequitable for the following reasons:
- unlike income tax, rates are not paid according to
means. They are paid according to the value of the
land and this may increase with inflation, changes of
zoning and so on, while the occupier’'s income may
not increase
 at all;
- although every citizen uses the amenities provided
by local bodies, not all citizens pay rates. Generally
rates do not take account of the number of people
living on a property.
The Values Party would
e Abolish rates on residential property and substitute a local income
tax set by regional and city or district councils and collected by central
government concurrently with national income tax.
This means
 of collecting
 local body
 revenues
 would
have the following advantages
 over the existing rating
system:
it would be paid according to means. Those on low
incomes, especially pensioners, would pay a great
deal less than they now pay in rates;
the burden of local body finance would fall on all
82
Community
We see local authorities as the most important means
of fostering a sense of community and a feeling of
involvement, which is lacking in our society at the
present time.
The Values Party would
e Develop a National Recreation Plan to determine local, regional and
national responsibilities.
e Encourage
 local
 authorities
 to
 set
 up
 community
 centres
 in
consultation with local community councils providing such facilities as
advice bureaux; day care centres, sports and cultural amenities;
homework centres, offices for Family Planning, Plunket and a
community based policeman, a hall and meeting rooms.
e Encourage local authorities to employ community social workers
who would work in the field in close liaison with community advice
bureaux and existing social welfare agencies.
e Encourage local authorities to set up branch offices in local
communities with specialist staff in attendance, at least on a part-time
basis.
e Encourage local authorities to give employees the opportunity to
spend working time [one day a month, for example] on community
service.
e Encourage local authorities to pay a fulltime salary to mayors and
committee chairmen where necessary, and pay an adequate honor-
arjum to councillors to enable a wider cross-section of the community
to stand for office.
e Encourage local authorities to publicise meetings and agenda
widely.
e Require Public Notices to be written in easily understandable
language.
o Encourage local authorities to prepare with public participation a
full register of objects, buildings and sites of historic, scientific,
architectural
 or environmental
 value and to budget for the
maintenance or gradual acquisition of property on this register.
The profit motive of private land developers has
proved to be inconsistent with the interests of the
community. The activities of these developers have
resulted in “scorched earth” subdivisions designed to
reap the best monetary return for the developer rather
than develop a congenial environment for those who
will live there.
 Natural
 amenities
 are frequently
 totally
destroyed in the interests of the developer.
Giving sole power to regional and local government
will ensure development
 of subdivisions
 in the interest
of the people who will live in them. It will also result in
cheaper section costs by avoiding the situation where
rural land prices soar on a change
 of zoning, since local
bodies would be able to purchase
 land at the rural
valuation.
The Values Party would
e Encourage
 local authorities
 to update
 building
 ordinances
 to allow
more flexibility in the use of materials and construction methods, and
to enable the construction of groups of dwellings on a “community”
concept with common facilities.
e Require mayors, councillors and those standing for office to make
full disclosure of relevant financial interests.
¢ Provide a major increase
 in financial
 support
 to local bodies for the
construction of sewage treatment
 plants.
e Encourage
 local authorities
 to amend
 bylaws to permit
 the use of
properly serviced septic tanks where it is environmentally sound to do
SO.
e Allow local residents’ associations to appear before the Town and
Country Planning Appeal Board in order to object to proposals.
¢ Make the Town and Country Act binding on the Crown.
