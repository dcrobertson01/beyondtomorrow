Thanks to the efforts of previous governments,
 and
to the determination
 of our citizens, New Zealanders
are
 generally
 well
 housed.
 No New
 Zealand
government could tolerate a situation in which large
numbers of citizens were without satisfactory housing.
But
 the
 general
 well-being
 is not
 shared
 by all
groups. Financial barriers
 are erected
 against first
home seekers
 and low income
 earners,
 and inner city
residents face relatively high rents for relatively poor
accommodation.
The present administration
 has made strenuous
efforts to minimise the financial barriers and has
encouraged the building of more houses than ever
before. But still there is talk of a housing shortage.
Thousands of New Zealanders know the frustration of
being on a State
 or Council waiting
 list.
As in so many other fields, it is not so much a
question of shortage as a question of distribution. The
number of untenanted dwellings is tending to increase
while the number of occupants per dwelling continues
to fall.
Population stabilisation policies would have the most
significant
 long term effect on New Zealand's
 housing
problems. As an illustration of this, the present
administration
 attacked
 ‘the housing shortage”
vigorously in 1974 by building in the region of 35,000
new houses. But in the same year there was a net gain
of 30,000 new immigrants. At the end of it we still had a
“housing shortage”.
Housing Administration
The Values Party believes that the proper functions of
Head Office would be better performed through a
Housing Commission than through a centralised
Housing Corporation.
80
The Values Party would
e Encourage the Commission in its functions of research, innovation
and policy development.
 The Commission
 could also function
 as an
investment commission.
e Divide the Housing Corporation
 itself into Regional
 Housing
Councils.
e Encourage
 district and community
 levels of government
 to follow
the lead set by Wellington's
 City Council in pursuing a vigorous policy
of building accommodation.
s Establish residents’ planning committees [through Regional
Authorities under the Local Government Act] to examine all planning
applications in each community council area.
e Place sole power for subdividing land for urban purposes in
regional government.
Public Housing
+ Make
 adequate
 and satisfactory
 accommodation
 for low income
groups and first home seekers priorities in public housing. A vigorous
policy of dwelling
 building would be pursued
 for as long as necessary
until population has stabilised.
e Set public house rentals at 20 per cent of occupants’ income, with a
mechanism for rental reviews.
e Grant public loans for housing up to 90 per cent of valuation,
subject
 only to the ability to repay and with preference
 to low income
earners.
e Set interest rates on loans proportional to income. Lower income
earners would have lower rates of interest. Interest rates would be
subject to the same kind of mechanism for review as rentals.
e Make finance available to people wishing to buy or maintain sound
older homes
 as well as to those
 buying
 or building
 new homes. The
Values Party seeks the conservation
 and renovation of existing
housing stock as far as possible, especially if such renovation will add
to the possible number of occupants.
 However, all such loans would
be conditional on some form of rent and speculation control.
eo Encourage district and community governments
 to establish
“housing counselling services”. The services and expertise of private
architects, planners, and valuers would be available to citizens at sub-
sidised rates
 and those
 of officers
 of the
 local authorities
 freely
accessible.
Progressive Homebuilding
The Values Party would introduce a Progressive
Homebuilding Scheme to cater for those who wish to
build gradually over a period of time. The scheme
would cover newly-planned buildings, partly completed
buildings,
 and completed
 buildings
 undergoing
extension and improvement. Such a scheme would
offer:
- secure land tenure for the occupier;
- professional building services available to the home
builder;
- adequate
 building supervision available to the
owner;
- loan assistance for the costs qf design, supervision,
specialist sub-contracts, materials.
Progressive
 homebuilding
 assistance
 could be
conditional upon:
- a housing deposit or building fund being saved;
- design to be completed within 6 months of approval.
- building. being sufficiently completed to occupy
within 2 years;
- the building being completed as designed within 6
years;
- controls on selling or subletting.
Progressive homebuilding assistance could be tied
into suspensory Home Improvement Loans.
Planning and Design:
If New Zealand
 continues
 the present
 patterns
 of trying
to satisfy the residential needs of the community in a
piecemeal fashion, insoluble problems will be created
for ourselves and our children. The carving up of good
agricultural land into 10-acre blocks or suburban
subdivisions is not in the national interest. The day of
the quarter-acre section is gone for most people in the
cities;
 New Zealand
 already
 has enough
 of them.
The Values Party does not support the massing of
large areas of public housing. It supports a planning
procedure in which the material and non-material
needs of citizens are met by being considered
throughout a process of discussion and consultation,
and by being mandatory upon private or community
developers. Social and commercial services, public
amenities, recreation, access to public transport, and
the needs of community development
 must be
considered during planning and before building. We
are not convinced
 that existing legislation
 is
satisfactory in this regard.
The Values Party Would take these steps:
e In all new residential areas, except for ‘feeder roads”, road widths
would be limited to two-lane traffic only. Pedestrian
 facilities including
walkthroughs would be completed at the same time as private car
facilities. Butchers, dairies, groceries, greengroceries, playgrounds,
and community centres should be completed at the same time as
houses. "Cul de sacs” should be provided wherever practicable. The
special needs of women and children should be considered. No plan
should be implemented until it has been approved by those currently
rearing children.
e High-rise housing would be permitted but only in exceptional
circumstances where it could be shown that there is a proven need
and demand and if the building design would not be deterimental to
the surrounding neighbourhood, or to the occupants.
The same principles would apply to high-rise buildings
intended for commercial or office use.
e The policy of giving
 preference
 to ‘first home-seekers’
 would
 be
extended to include assistance to those, especially young people,
wishing to experiment with alternative residential styles. An alter-
native residential style would be no bar to participation in the Pro-
gressive Homebuilding Scheme.
 .
e Full rights of tenure would be granted to ohu which have
progressed beyond the probationary period of temporary tenancy.
¢ Basic education on housing and accommodation would be provided
through secondary schools, and correspondence and Polytechnical
courses in basic town planning, home design, and home construction
would be made available to intending home owners.
e Licenced
 cafes and small local ‘pubs’ without
 large parking
 facilities
would be encouraged, and the building of large taverns discouraged.
e Speculative building would be discouraged by requiring proof of a
definite need before planning permission was given people wishing to
erect commercial buildings.
e An immediate investigation would be made to promote improved
housing quality, efficiency and longevity.
e Government buildings of any prominence would be the subject of
architectural competitions, ensuring that a number of alternative
designs are available for consideration.
s Ordinances and model by-laws would be amended so that they do
not discriminate against town houses or alternative residential styles.
e A Commission of Inquiry into land and property speculation for
capital gain would be established. The terms of reference of the
inquiry would extend to the costs and benefits of gradual nationalisa-
tion of land.
¢ Traditional lending institutions would be required to make available
a fixed percentage
 of their total funds for housing mortgage and home
improvement
 loans on the same basis that fixed investment
 in
government securities is now compulsorily separated.
e The Values Party recognises the role of the private sector in
housing, including developers, builders and tradesmen, and real
estate agents. lts policy aims to ensure that the private sector in
general can live up to its claims of providing necessary
 social service.
Values supports a joint approach to housing with public and private
sectors working together to provide viable mixed communities.
