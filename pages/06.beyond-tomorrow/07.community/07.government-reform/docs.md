Government Reform
The basic question of government is “Who makes what
decisions how?” The Values Party realises that its
answers to these questions will mean major changes to
our present system of government.
The pace and direction of political, economic, social
and cultural change has meant that our present system
is inadequate. If we wish to attain justice and retain
democracy we must do more than fiddle with an
inadequate
 system. Values seeks to head off the sort of
government
 developing
 in New Zealand - big and
centralised, with too much power and too many
functions, requiring a large, distant and faceless
bureaucracy.
 :
We are committed
 to the development
 of a
decentralised
 participatory
 democracy
 within a just,
co-operative
 society. Only a strong sense
 of community
can counter the massness and alienation of western
society. And this feeling of togetherness
 can be
promoted to some extent by doing in an intelligent
manner what many radicals and anarchists are calling
for - “Power to the People”.
Decentralisation
Values’
 policies
 consistently
 call
 for
 more
responsibility, more power and more autonomy for
regional community
 levels of government,
 and
redefinition of the role of central government and head
office.
Our long-term objective is a form of government in
which the responsibility and authority for social
services and amenities rests as closely as possible with
the people using them. This would apply particularly in
health, education, welfare, housing, land use, and as far
as possible throughout the economy.
Decentralisation
 does not mean simply making
Napier-Hastings for example into a mini-Wellington for
the Hawkes
 Bay region. It means
 the development
 of
social services in Waipukurau, Dannevirke, Porang-
ahau and Pongoroa too. Nor does decentralisation
mean that all power and functions
 are taken away from
the centre. It means rather that the centre is freed to
perform its proper roles of co-ordination and commun-
ication, maintaining balance and justice, legislating
minimum standards, safeguarding civil rights, and
researching and developing innovations. International
relations, and national transport are examples of
government functions that would not be decentral-
ised.
We see such decentralisation
 as vital to the
development of true communities in which the social
needs of kinship and co-operation are fostered by the
regular involvement
 of citizens in deciding the
conditions
 that affect their
 lives.
We see such decentralisation as vital to curing the
diseases threatening the health of our democracy - ali-
enation, apathy, sectional greed and competitive
84
individualism. These conditions flourish when govern-
ment is distant and unresponsive; then, government
itself, which is really “Us”, becomes “They”. In the
face-to-face government of decentralisation,
 enlight-
ened self-interest alone advises that it is unwise to
exploit today the people who can make the decisions
governing your
 life tomorrow
 - your
 neighbours
 and
workmates.
Effective decentralisation is impossible without an
independent and sufficient source of revenue for each
level of government.
 More and more loans from central
government can only put local government
 “in hock” to
central government and tie it to central conditions. The
best method of financing local government will lie in
some kind of regular payment for the community
services provided by local government and in return
for community-generated
 values enjoyed by citizens.
This requires no radical change - rates based on land
values
 provide
 such a source
 now. But rating
 has its
disadvantages
 too.
The Values Party is currently investigating
 various
alternatives for financing local government.
The Values Party would
e Endorse
 the
 general
 objectives
 of the Local Government
 Act. We
would however amend it to:
- give autonomy and greater responsibility to the proposed
community councils;
- acknowledge the role of neighbourhood councils or local pro-
gressive associations in government. There might be several of these
within the territory of a community council;
- establish statutory procedures for providing local government with
an independent and sufficient source of revenue.
o Amend
 the
 procedures
 of the Local Government
 Commission
 so
that it is able to hear submissions from individuals and community
groups
 as well as local authorities.
 We would accelerate
 the develop-
ment of regional and community levels of government.
e Bring harbour boards under regional government control and town
planning legislation.
Participatory Democracy
It is decades since New Zealand had a majority
government. Even in 1972, 52 per cent of the voters
did not vote for Labour. Fewer than half a dozen MPs
got the support of more than half their electorate.
Values believes that our present political system is
fundamentally undemocratic and unjust. It points to
evidence in the fact that most MPs are male, over 40,
and from the professions, business, farming, or union
administration.
 In all these
 respects
 MPs
 are
 not
representative of the population. Recent free votes in
Parliament indicate the extent to which Parliament
opinion is lagging behind public opinion. A few people
in a few marginal seats determine who will be the next
government.
In a truly democratic society any citizen should feel
that he or she can influence
 government.
 How many of
us feel this in 19757 We get a solitary vote among
thousands every three years and are then cast into the
role of spectators of political games.
Obviously these conditions will not change overnight
and cannot be changed except through a strong and
active movement of people “at the grassroots level”.
Such a movement has emerged in New Zealand in
recent years. It is still scattered, largely inarticulate,
not very well organised,
 nor very confident
 of itself. But
it is there. Manapouri, Aro Street, Otara are places
where some of its battles have been won. It is a
movement towards participatory democracy, and the
Values Party is only one part of it.
In its role as a social action movement, the Values
Party seeks to demonstrate that the ordinary citizen is
not powerless. He or she can join with others and make
their voices heard and their ideas considered. The
Values Party does not need to become government to
enact
 its policies.
 Many can be enacted
 in their
 daily
lives by members.
Greater openness of government is a priority of the
Values Party, and the encouragement of participatory
democracy an important feature of its aspect as a social
action movement. At present
 most government
decisions are made behind closed doors. Items of
information on matters of vital public interest - for
example, nuclear power, justification for price rises,
and the arguments being used by pressure groups and
public servants in their relations with the political
executive - are kept away from the public. Decisions
made in cabinet and caucus at central government
level, or committee
 and caucus at local government
level, are presented
 as faits accompli. Only with the
greatest difficulty can a dissenting public reverse these
decisions.
The Values Party
eo Endorses
 the intentions behind the Educational Development
Conference
 and would promote similar conferences, seeking the
views of the
 public,
 when
 there
 are major
 policy
 changes
contemplated
 [for example, in health and local government].
e Would examine present legislation and regulations
 and amend
them so that planning decisions at all levels of government
 were made
only after a process of consultation
 with those affected, during which
process the participation of interested citizens was actively sought.
e Sees the Crown as distinct from the policies of central government
and would amend
 the Town and Country
 Planning
 and Public Works
Acts so that central government and its agencies were subject to the
normal planning procedures and ordinances of central government.
o Give members of the public access to all government records as of
right. A departmental head could deny access to certain types of
information but such decisions would be open to appeal to the
Ombudsman.
e Would increase use of referenda, questionnaires and pilot schemes.
es Make legal aid available to individuals and community groups
taking cases to appeal before Town and Country Planning Appeal
Boards.
Parliamentary Reform
In 1972 we stated ‘‘the Values Party believes that
there is an urgent need for reform of Parliament in
order to make it a more effective and relevant body”.
Many of the policies we stated then are contained in
the 1975 Electoral Amendment Act.
The Values Party calls for
eo A 15-year
 maximum
 term
 for all MPs.
e Establishment
 of a parliamentary forum convened by the
Opposition, for the public to air grievances and suggest alternative
policies.
e Increased youth representation on decision-making bodies.
e In-service training for MPs.
eo Areview procedure for legislation whereby each new bill contains a
statement of its objectives, its estimated costs and benefits, and
specifies a time, not more than 20 years, during which it must be
reviewed.
e Liberalising of standing orders to allow private members’ bills that
propose increases in expenditure.
New Zealanders
 expect
 more than
 is humanly
possible
 from their
 MPs, who are expected
 not only to
represent the interests of constituents, but also to
keep up with everything going on in all fields of govern-
ment, to be effective members of their party, and to
prepare for and participate in parliament. When the
responsibilities of cabinet are added as well we
wonder why many talented people do not make
effective use of their talents.
The Values Party
e Supports increased
 secretarial
 aid for MPs.
e Would expect any MPs from their party to delegate
 some
 of their
responsibilities to their local branch so that they were able to remain
healthy and effective representatives.
e Believes more fundamental
 changes are needed to make
parliament relevant and effective in a participatory democracy, and
that any proposed changes should be subjected to the kind of public
scrutiny and discussion pioneered by the Educational Development
Conference.
The Values Party has never been one that is part-
icularly attracted by the style and procedures of our
present so-called debating system. We feel that
“adversary”
 or ‘confrontation’
 politics has had
adverse effects on the reputation of parliament, the
consideration of legislation, and even on legislation
itself.
We see no reason in opposing or amending
legislation simply because the other side introduced it
and little point in participating in the petty points-scor-
ing or Tower of Babel aspects of parliamentary debate.
We feel the two-party system is largely to blame for this
situation.
We realise that adversary situations, disfranchise-
ment between elections and parliamentary pettiness
are deeply ingrained in New Zealand tradition and
cannot be changed for the better overnight. That is no
reason to endorse them in the meantime.

Role of Experts
The Values Party believes that the most reliable
experts on a decision are those who are going to be
affected
 by it.
Science, technology, general social change and the
specialised professions have developed to the stage
that experts in these relatively narrow fields have
immense
 influence
 over decisions
 that will affect all of
us.
More and more political decisions have to be made
on issues that are highly technical as well as far-reach-
ing in nature.
Current examples are debates and controversy
about such issues as private versus public transport
systems; import quotas for new technology; the
approvals or restraints on defoliants and drugs; the
introduction of cable television and FM radio; the best
method of superannuation; long-term social and envir-
onmental costs versus short-term economic benefits of
aluminium smelters/beech forest utilisation/container
ports/power plants. The role of technical experts in
advising on these issues must be acknowledged and
safeguarded if we are to make wise decisions. But this
role poses major problems for participatory democracy
and social justice.
The Values Party believes that its principles of
justice, participatory democracy, decentralisation and
community control, and the policies it has developed to
implement these principles, are part of the answer. We
suggest that the role of experts must be confined to
providing reliable information on the technical details
of various alternatives, and answering the questions as
posed for them by both elected politicians and com-
munity groups and individuals.
If they are to perform this role well they must be
given the resources and opportunities to respond to
the demands made of them.
The general public may not be competent
 to judge
issues on technical details but it is competent to judge
between conflicting values and to set overall goals. This
role is vital in the framing of questions asked of experts
by government.
In voting Values, for example, the public is clearly
endorsing the general principle that long-term social
and environmental costs are a higher priority than
short-term economic benefits. Such an endorsement
will not change the technical detail but will change the
kinds of questions
 experts
 are asked, and it will shuffle
the technical detail into a different order of priority.
The Values Party feels there is a chance of
preserving democracy and justice in New Zealand if the
above points are recognised and the following policies
implemented:
86
o All expert
 bodies
 should
 include wherever
 appropriate
 non-experts
who represent important groups in the community [for example,
women, youth, and consumers].
e Expert
 government
 departments
 such as the
 DSIR must
 answer
relevant questions on political issues raised by community groups and
individuals, as well as questions posed by politicians. Some help in
framing these questions should also be provided.
e The general
 public should
 have access
 to all information
 on political
issues
 under
 certain
 conditions.
 [Refer
 also
 to ‘Participatory
Democracy].
e The general principle of social control over technology and science
embodied in the Technology and Science Assessment Board [refer
“Technology] should be extended into transport, manufacturing and
health.
The Public Service
The main expert agency in government is the Public
Service. The Values Party believes that New Zealand's
Public Service has in general served New Zealand well.
If it is not the most imaginative, dynamic and respon-
sive Public Service in the world that is largely because
New Zealanders have not yet asked it to be.
eo The Values Party would amend
 Public Service regulations to make
it easier for private sector personnel to be appointed to top levels of
the Public Service.
Values Party policies in industrial relations, the role
of experts,
 and participatory
 democracy
 will have direct
effects on the Public Service and will have indirect
effects on most other sectors of society. The result of
these policies would be a Public Service which is more
responsive to the needs of people and the demands of
social change.
Actually this factory produces nothing.
It is just a device to employ labour.
