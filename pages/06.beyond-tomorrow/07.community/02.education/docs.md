School bell go ding-dong-ding.
The children all line up.
They do what they are told.
They mind their manners well.
Their little lives are all laid out.
Oh, teachers of the world:
teach them to fake it well.
Just teach them not to criticize,
to ‘ves’ the bosses,
 impress
 the clients.
Just get them into the factories, into production,
get them into line.
Mama don't seem to care
if she may break their hearts.
She clips their wings off.
They never learn to fly.
Buffy Sainte-Marie
The critical importance
 of education
 in either
maintaining the present
 society, or developing an
alternative
 to
 it, makes
 education
 an area
 of high
priority for the Values Party.
The Values Party has followed these guidelines
 in
developing
 an education
 policy:
- education is the development of the whole person
(physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, individual,
economic, political, social) rather than simply the
processing of the person into society;
- equal access to education is one of the entitlements
of New Zealand
 citizens;
- education is a lifelong growth and not something
confined to formal institutions or particular age-
groups;
- decentralisation of the administration of education
Is a necessary long-term goal, to be achieved through
making functions and decisions the responsibility of
the most appropriate levels;
as school structures
 and procedures
 are a
statement to coming generations of what society
expects of its citizens, the objectives and procedures
of co-operation and participatory democracy must be
visible in the administration of schools:
- equality of educational opportunity requires that
there be diversity in educational styles to allow for
individual differences and preferences; but diversity
without equal opportunity of access is iniquitous.
If New Zealand
 is to develop
 a just, co-operative,
 and
community-based society, education is a vital aspect of
that development. Our present system of education is
competitive,
 its administration
 hierarchical,
 and
effective
 power rests
 in the hands
 of a few.
In 1972 the Values Party said that “our education
system is not equipping young people with the skills
they need to cope with life in a changing
 world ... At the
present time many of the topics which our children are
being taught are irrelevant to their needs, and the way
in which they are being taught renders them of even
less value”. While the criticism remains valid, we feel
72
that it would be no improvement just to update the
system so that it caters better to a society which is
fundamentally competitive and materialistic.
The intentions behind the Educational Development
Conference were laudable, and the Values Party would
implement the major recommendations of the final
report of the Advisory Council on Educational Planning.
Some of the immediate problems facing education
that haven't been addressed adequately by recent
governments or the Conference include the whole
relationship
 between
 education
 and work, the
impossibility of “second chance” education when
adults need to receive a full-time wage to survive, the
developing exclusiveness
 of teachers,
 an admin-
istrative
 structure
 which prevents
 people at all levels -
central, regional, or local school - from working
efficiently and effectively, and the necessity for a hard
look at the comparative
 facilities
 and roles of technical
institutes and universities.
Deeper problems
 haven't really been tackled at all.
As we approach the centenary of our present system in
New Zealand, 70 per cent of the labour force have no
educational
 qualification
 at all; the ratio of males who
are qualified
 to females
 is about 3:1; there
 is a
conservative estimate of between 50,000 and 100,000
adult New Zealanders who are virtually illiterate; and
rural, lower-class or maori students make do with
poorer facilities in an alien system.
The Values Party
e Seeks complete reform of the decision-making process in education.
This would be achieved through a re-arrangement of functions and
powers among schools, and community, regional and central levels of
administration.
e Believes functions should be discharged at the most appropriate
level but if regional,
 community
 and local school levels are to perform
new functions effectively they must have greater experience of
responsibility and better relations with the people whom their
decisions will affect.
e Would act immediately to establish Community Education Councils
consisting of elected members representing
 teachers, parents,
students, the general community, and appointed representatives
 of
the administrators. These councils would be based on a high school
and its contributing primary schools and pre-school organisations.
Existing boards serving some of these functions would be phased out.
e Would expand the responsibilities and change the composition of
the Educational Development Council. With the Minister as chairman,
and representatives of Parliament, teacher and community groups,
and the Department, the new Educational Development Council
would set current
 and long-term priorities
 for educational
development, establish minimum allocations of funds and channel
central funds so as to compensate for any regional differences. It
could also act as a body of appeal on disputes, and have the statutory
powers of the Minister.
Funding
The Values Party would
e Give central and regional levels power to allocate proportions of
expenditure, and promote educational priorities with the proportion
of funds remaining.
e Give community Education Councils greater independent loan
raising powers. Bonuses would be available to Community Education
Councils which, while meeting overall funding requirements, kept
their spending within their total allocation. Communities could thus
plan their incomes to meet their incoming needs.
® Seek to increase the percentage of the national income devoted to
public expenditure on education, rather than just keep expenditure in
step with inflation.
® Give increased priority to funds for research and development,
achieving lower teacher:pupil ratios at all levels up to sixth form,
continuing education, and pre-school education.
Curriculum and Assessment
The Values Party
e Believes there is a case for a compulsory core of the curriculum to
foster the minimum skills needed by our society but that other
content and skills should be learnt on a voluntary basis according to
the individual's need, to whatever level he may specify.
e¢ Would remove sex discrimination and intelligence-level limitations
on such options as home economics, woodwork or work experience.
e Would support, through the Education Development Council, such
innovations as flexible timetabling and open-plan schools to reduce
the demand for new school buildings and to make more efficient use of
school plant.
e Would press for development of a syllabus and teacher materials in
important
 living skills such
 as law and citizenship,
 consumer
 rights,
rights and responsibilities
 of employers and employees, town
planning, housing and accommodation.
e Endorses
 the implementation
 of the handbook
 ‘Human
Development and Personal Relationships’ and would actively press
for open discussion
 in the schools
 of controversial
 matters.
 [We see no
good point in denying our teenagers the freedom of discussion
allowed their elders, and much benefit to society in encouraging its
future citizens to make informed judgements.)
 ‘
e Would examine school texts and teaching material to eliminate any
sexual bias. [See Education section in “Status of Women".]
e Would make Maori language and Polynesian culture compulsory to
schools, leaving it open to the local Community
 Education Council to
decide whether it should also be compulsory to students.
e Does not favour the sort of segregation that goes with streaming or
special schools, nor assessment procedures which rely on competition
with others for places or passes, or which do not take account of the
particular talents or skills of the student.
e Would abolish national examinations and would promote internal
assessment
 procedures which are used for valid educational
objectives. We regard teacher groups as the most reliable and
informed as to what is a valid educational objective.
Some changes are happening to our education
system. We are not sure that these are always for the
better or are always co-ordinated. Internal assessment,
for example, is an advance in itself, but if it means that
students’
 and teachers’
 workloads
 are
 increased
 still
further - many secondary students are spending 60
and 70 hours a week on school work even now - better
teacher training, especially in-service training, and
better conditions of work for teachers, are a necessary
adjunct.
Pre-School
The Values Party
e Seeks to make pre-school education available in all existing and
new primary school areas. Where no alternative exists, pre-school
facilities would be made available in the primary schools themselves.
eo Would make development courses and day-care centres available
for parents and expectant parents through such existing facilities as
secondary schools, would support the Parents’ Centre Movement and
similar organisations in the establishment
 of these, and would
support the establishment of play centres.
e Advocates an extension of aid to approved play centres and
kindergartens.
 Any centre which provides
 custodial
 care should
 mest
specified standards, and should be assisted to meet these standards.
Standards in the areas of human relationships and of qualified staff
are held by the Values Party to be more important than standards in
the physical conditions of buildings.
Schools
Management of a school should be in the hands of
those familiar with the school. Decision-making
procedures should anticipate the students’ rights.and
73
responsibilities as citizens. There should be more
attention paid to making schools more congenial
environments for both pupils and staff. Pupils need to
be
 treated
 like
 human
 beings
 rather
 than
 as
components of mass production.
Instead of harrassing and prosecuting truants and
those who are unable to adapt to school, the Values
Party would investigate
 alternative
 methods
 of
education more suited to their needs.
The Values Party would
e Liberalise correspondence school admission requirements.
e Make the school leaving age flexible and ensure that all students
and parents know that every New Zealand citizen is entitled fo 15
years’ free education, and that this period would not have to be taken
all at once. People should be able to return to secondary school to
continue their education at any age.
e Upgrade and extend school library services, so that they can cope
with the demands of curriculum innovations requiring more
audio-visual facilities.
eo Extend guidance counselling and supportive aid. We believe early
diagnosis of emotional disturbances and learning difficulties is more
important than later attempts to cope with them and would therefore
concentrate on upgrading these facilities in primary schools.
Intermediate Schools
We believe that instead of a healthy mixing of age
groups such as exists in traditional primary schools,
intermediate schools isolate children at a particularly
awkward age from the influences of and responsi-
bilities to older and younger children. In teaching
subjects rather than children, intermediate schools
74
pander to obsessions with prestige learning, at an early
stage, of science and languages. In removing children
from the smaller
 local primary
 school,
 intermediates
force children to travel further, to a larger institution,
with which neither
 they nor their parents
 are likely to
develop a sense of belonging.
The Values Party
o Would convert
 existing
 intermediate
 schools
 into primary
 or
secondary
 schools
 according to the local needs and the particular
situation.
Diversity and Equality
The Values Party
 recognises
 the need
 for alternatives
in education but rejects
 the
 concept
 of elitist
independent schools.
The Values Party
e Would make
 it obligatory
 for Community
 Education
 Councils
 to
provide a variety of educational styles within their district, to give
students and parents more freedom of choice.
e Supports the development of less formal educational agencies such
as Learning Exchanges, community colleges, Masterton’s Community
Action Programme,
 and “schools without walls” such as
Christchurch’'s Four Avenues. We would make further finance
available to assist such ventures, and seek to integrate them into the
State system to preserve equality of access.
¢ Recognises that certain areas are poorly provided for in social
services and that teachers and schools bear the brunt of associated
problems.
Tertiary and Continuing Education
The Values Party would
e Establish an adult education bursary for those taking “second
chance” education.
e Expand community colleges, education through the broadcasting
media, and correspondence courses, and would publicise existing
opportunities for post-secondary education.
e Seek to apportion tertiary education funds in ways that redress
present imbalances.
e Ensure that every secondary student has the opportunity of at least
one period of work-experience before leaving school.
e Ensure that vocational guidance was available to every school
leaver. Vocational guidance officers would be attached to the offices of
Community Education Councils, and their work extended so that their
services were available on demand not only to school leavers but to
mothers returning to the labour force, workers changing jobs, and
people approaching retirement.
e Undertake an immediate full-scale review of the existing facilities
and needs of continuing education. In particular the number of
technical institutes should be increased and existing buildings and
equipment considerably upgraded.
Teachers
The Values Party would
e Retain the responsibility of registering teachers within the
Department of Education, but supports the moves to have teacher
grading made the responsibility of the profession.
e Pay all teachers
 on the same [secondary]
 salary scale recognising
that teachers
 at all levels give the same
 kind of service to the
community. There is no reason why a primary teacher with a B.A.
should
 receive
 less than secondary
 teacher
 with a B.A., nor why the
principal of a secondary school should receive more than the head of
a primary school of similar size.
e Favour the phasing out of the bond system. We would replace it by a
system of alternative service in the public service and would bring
student teacher bursaries, along with other tertiary and adult
education
 bursaries,
 into line with the cost of living.
e Encourage more men to be involved in pre-school and primary
education and more women in tertiary education, to achieve a more
even sex balance. [In kindergartens, the ratio of male to female is
0:700; in primary schools 6:10; in secondary 6:4; in tertiary, 6:1.] We
would also encourage people of more mature years to enter training
colleges and be given greater financial assistance. Appointments for
all teaching
 positions
 would
 be
 made
 by Community
 Education
Councils, teachers, teachers’ unions and departmental
 represent-
atives in consultations.
 3
e Make appointments of principals a matter of election by the staff
concerned and the School Council or similar body. These appoint-
ments would be reviewed continuously by the staff and would be
subject to termination at any time by the election of a successor. Once
a term as principal was completed, the person could resume normal
teaching duties or apply for a principal's position elsewhere.
Often principals are the best teachers in the service,
but their administrative duties keep them out of the
classroom.
 Few have
 any administrative
 or manage-
ment training before taking up their jobs.
The Values Party would
e Extend the system of Bursars to relieve the administrative
burden on Principals, and would expand in-service courses in school
administration.
e Enable teachers to have access to in-service training at a rate of
one term per three years’ service, and encourage schools to promote
staff discussions
 on objectives
 and procedures.
 All teachers
 should
 be
recompensed for expenditure they make to maintain their training.
e Give tangible support to schools and staff involved in helping
student teachers on section from training colleges so that sections
can achieve
 their
 full educational
 potential.
e Support an increase in ancillary aides for teachers, and would
encourage the employment as ancillaries in schools, of parents and
grandparents from the community.
Education and the Community
The Values Party sees Community Education Councils
as having sufficient responsibilities to justify their
having accessible
 offices. As well as displaying work
from local schools, community education offices would
advise and enrol local students,
 house
 specialist
equipment
 and
 staff,
 provide
 secretarial
 and
co-ordinating
 services
 to local schools,
 and
 promote
education in the community.
The Values Party strongly supports regular school
involvement with the community and especially
parents in both directions, outsiders coming in and
making use of school plant, and students going out to
help the
 community
 and
 experience
 how the
 adult
world works. We see this as the special responsibility
of Community Education Councils in liaison with School
Councils, and would ensure a specific financial
allocation from central government to support and
encourage
 it.
