“Health is a state of complete mental, physical and
social well-being, and not merely the absence of
disease or infirmity”
World Health Organisation
76
As a primary principle the Party believes that everyone
is entitled to the best possible health service, that the
only criterion
 should
 be need, that
 people
 who need
care should be entitled to it as of right, but that the
total service has to be within the limits of the resources
of the country. The Party further contends that
because resources are finite the care and services
available must be spread as equitably as possible.
Many people today find it difficult
 to get the medical
attention they need. An estimated 10 per cent does not
have access to a general practitioner. There is an
overall shortage of doctors which is made worse by an
unequal distribution of general practitioners through
the
 country.
 Affluent
 suburbia
 is comparatively
 well
doctored.
 Medical centres
 and group practices
continue to appear while the poorer working class
suburbs and rural areas struggle on with too few
practitioners.
Hospitals are often large impersonal places. Waiting
lists for operations and chronic sick beds continue to
grow. In the last 25 years the standard of New
Zealand's health services has fallen from second or
third to fifteenth out of sixteen western countries.
Prospects for a better future are obscured by a
Government White Paper which projects a solution
based on bureaucratic centralism and health service,
remote control.
New Zealand
 must train
 more doctors,
 and improve
conditions for them so that fewer emigrate. What New
Zealand must not do is import doctors from countries
poorer than ourselves who need them more than we
do.
How can we encourage
 doctors
 to work
 in the
unpopular areas?
Many people assume
 that extra
 money will solve the
problem, but already general practitioners in Porirua
are some of the most highly paid in the country. Yet
Porirua still has a shortage of doctors. Practitioners
tend to shy away from the under-doctored areas
because they inevitably mean overwork. They are also
less attractive
 places in which to live, and doctors
 may
be isolated
 from their
 colleagues
 and from post-
graduate education.
Different solutions may be needed in different
places.
 Extra
 para-medical
 services,
 improved
equipment,
 better
 organised
 working
 hours
 would all
help.
Under a decentralised
 health service, individual
communities could design a service to suit themselves.
Wealthy people get easier access to private hospitals,
bypassing the public waiting lists. (Private medical
Insurance schemes expect to sign up about half the
population within the next few years.) Private hospitals
deflect the energies of consultants away from their
public duties, and they also remove the pressure from
the rich and influential people to work for improvement
of the public system.
The Values Party would
elnstitute a socially responsible community health service and phase
in a system where medical and para-medical practitioners are
employed by each health authority. Each community could decide how
it would pay its doctors.
sincrease the number of doctors trained, by establishing pre-clinical
schools at Wellington and Christchurch.
elmprove conditions of service in areas of greatest need, to encourage
doctors to practise there.
eAim to improve the public hospital system and phase out the need for
private hospitals.
elmprove general work conditions for doctors, for example, hospital
doctors to work a basic forty hour week.
eGuarantee
 all general
 practitioners
 at least
 one month's
 holiday
 a
year and one month's postgraduate training.
eEncourage the development of group practices and heaith centres
with subsidised ancillary staff.
e Support community-based health services, especially the following:
- low rise community
 or district
 hospitals
 to cater
 for the majority
 of
surgical and medical cases from the area. These would be
community facilities and would provide special supportive services
for relatives of patients;
- community care centres [such as sheltered housing] for depend-
ent persons [such as psychiatric out-patients and the frail elderly];
- a focus for services such as family planning, ante and post natal
care, perhaps based at health centres.
Prevention is better than cure
New Zealand must have a health service and not just a
disease service. To a large extent infectious diseases
have now been conquered, and the diseases we face
today are the diseases of civilisation such as heart
disease,
 diabetes,
 and environmentally
 induced
diseases.
 A stable society
 would be healthier
 in all
these respects.
 The slower
 pace of life, the control of
pollution, and the regeneration of community would all
tend to reduce the incidence of the diseases of stress.
Prevention is also cheaper than cure. A dollar spent
on health education can save hundreds of dollars in
hospitals.
The Values Party would
slnstitute an immediate and massive health education programme.
sintroduce a programme to ensure adequate standards of industrial
safety and health.
elmprove the quality of water resources by encouraging further
reticulation, monitoring and tightly controlling pollution, and giving
subsidies
 to
 local
 authorities
 fo
 expand
 and
 upgrade
 sewage
treatment facilities.
eEstablish a network of community health centres. these would
include child health clinics for infant and pre-school children. [In such
clinics advice on infant care would be given to the mother on infants’
growth and general development checked and recorded. Parents
would also receive advice on family planning and contraceptive tech-
niques. The Values Party would make contraceptive aids free of
charge to the patient, and the contraceptive pill could be provided by
nurses without a doctor's prescription. This would make it easier for a
woman to get contraceptives and save doctors unnecessary work.
esEstablish health clinics in schools along the lines of the present
school dental clinics. These would be staffed by school medical
officers, and community nurses. Each child would be seen at regular
intervals, for periodic health screening - including visual and hearing
tests; the detection, investigation and supervision of handicapped
children; health education [including contraception and venereal
disease]; the control of infectious diseases; and special inquiries in
health, development and nutrition.
We recognise there are limits to the amount that can be
spent on health.
A health service is very expensive. Demands for
money for health are increasing rapidly as more
elaborate technologies are developed. In addition,
much of society's sickness produces symptoms in
individuals who then request medical assistance. Not
all these expectations can be met. There are limits to
the proportion of society's wealth which should be
spent upon health. The problem is how to apply these
limits. In a finite world, where the demands are infinite,
how should we decide our priorities?
As a general principle, the Values Party believes that
decisions are best made at the lowest possible level.
Decisions made by large centralised bureaucratic
bodies cannot take into account every individual case.
We therefore believe that priorities should be worked
out by members of the health professions together with
the public at a regional level.
The Values Party believes
eMembers of the health professions and members of the public should
debate what the objectives of a health service should be, and how to
measure them.
eMoney should be channeled to the regional health authorities in
proportion to the population of the region and in accordance with the
special needs of the region.
oA department of health economics would advise each region on how
best to meet its stated objectives with the limited funds available.
